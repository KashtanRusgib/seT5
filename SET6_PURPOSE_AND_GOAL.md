# seT6 Purpose and Goal

In seT6 we have implemented various schema(s) to build the ternary first full stack for the inevitable global shift to a fully ternary/multi radix world. The ongoing development of seT6 and Trit Linux & Trithon and all other features and modules and codeblocks that comprise the seT6 ternary first & ternary all the way down fullstack is to contiually determine the greatest imminent and emerging needs of the ternary/multi radix future that requires a complete rebuild and rethink of the flawed and faulty and error prone old world of binary based computing. This ongoing development seeks in all instances possible to conceive as fully as possible of the implications and needs of the entire computer hardware and software world and industires as the ternary/multi radix future emerges and to search for and find and research and understand all relevant hardware and software and protocol improvements and upgrades and components of this ternary/multi radix first world. From any and all available patents and papers and documentation the human & AI agents working on this development develop an empirical understanding of the hardware and software being developed and scheduled for market and industrial and governmental and medical and aerospace and AGI applications to futher the capbabilities and funcitonality and utility and value recieved by all users of seT6 by anticipating all needs current and future and thus developing seT6 to accomodate these new and improved ternary/multi radix archtectures and designs such that when the hardware arrives and when the protocols are instantiated the full ternary stack that is seT6 will already be available and tested and verified and at all times and in all decisions and choices made and code updates and commits this will be done and will only be done while maintaining the Sigma 9 level of rigorously tested and verifiable build quality resulting in 0 errors.

## Ternary-First Bridge Protocol (Mandatory — effective 2026-02-20)

Rather than risk regression to binary, when any aspect of seT6 and/or its full stack and modules encounters a different format situation, the protocol is and shall henceforth be: **rather than use binary internally, we will build bridges and converters as necessary to provide native hybrid interoperability functionality and utility** to increase the value of seT6 for all users. We build out and outwards with ternary-to-binary and multi-radix-to-binary OUTWARDS wherever necessary to build the ternary-first and ternary-all-the-way-down imminent emergent future. No internal binary regression is permitted. All binary compatibility is achieved through outward-facing bridge modules at the system boundary. See `ARCHITECTURE.md` §14A for implementation details. Violations are treated as Crown Jewel regressions and will be reverted.

## Terminology Policy (effective 2026-02-20)

Within seT6 development, we call things by their proper names: compiled ternary
executables are **trinaries** (not "binaries"), ternary digits are **trits** (not
"bits"), and ternary data units are **trytes** (not "bytes"). "Binary" is reserved
for actual base-2 interop bridges and host-substrate references. This aligns with
the industry shift toward ternary-native terminology (SherryLLM 2026, BitNet
b1.58, ternary-quantized Llama variants). We eat our own dog food — in language
as in code. See `CONTRIBUTING.md` for the full terminology table.
