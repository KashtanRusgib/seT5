DETAILED DESCRIPTION
With the rapid development of technologies such as artificial intelligence, automation, and intelligent driving, the data generated is also growing explosively. With the
advent of the big data era, processing huge amounts of data requires chips to have higher computing performance. On the one hand, the size of transistors can be
reduced, the number of transistors integrated on the chip can be increased, and the computing performance of the chip can be improved. However, when the size of
transistors is reduced to a certain extent, it becomes difficult to further reduce the size of transistors. On the other hand, large-scale integrated circuits can be set up to
achieve the purpose of improving the computing performance of the chip, but large-scale integrated circuits will bring higher power consumption and interconnection
complexity, and will also cause data processing delays.
The logic circuits currently integrated in chips are binary logic circuits. Compared with binary logic, multi-valued logic (MVL) uses three-value, four-value or even larger-
value logic to increase information density, which helps reduce the interconnection complexity of the chip. Circuit design implemented using multi-valued logic has
advantages in increasing information density, reducing chip area, and improving the computing power of integrated circuits. Therefore, it is currently possible to design
multi-valued logic circuits based on multi-valued logic to improve the computing performance of chips.
Among them, in multi-valued logic, the theoretical efficiency value of ternary logic is the highest, so deploying ternary logic circuits on a chip can improve the computing
performance of the chip. Accordingly, the design of ternary logic circuits is crucial. In some embodiments, the ternary logic circuit can also be called a ternary circuit or a
ternary logic calculation circuit.
In some embodiments, a decoder 11 and a binary circuit 12 may be deployed on a chip. Taking a chip implementing ternary addition calculation as an example, referring
to FIG. 1A , for example, the decoder 11 may include a decoder A and a decoder B, and the chip may receive input 1 and input 2, and perform a sum calculation on input 1
and input 2. Among them, input 1 includes A0, A1, and A2, and input 2 includes B0, B1, and B2.
Among them, after the chip receives input 1 and input 2, decoder A can convert input 1 into a binary logic value, decoder B can convert input 2 into a binary logic value,
and binary circuit 12 can add the binary logic value converted by decoder A and the binary logic value converted by decoder B to output the result.
Although the scheme in FIG1A can realize ternary logic addition calculation, the interconnection complexity of the circuit is much higher than that of the binary logic
circuit with the same function, and the calculation efficiency is low.
In some embodiments, the ternary logic circuit can be directly deployed according to the truth table of the ternary logic. The solution may include the following steps:
Step 1, develop a truth table for ternary logic.
Taking ternary addition calculation as an example, the addition truth table of ternary logic is shown in Figure 1B. It should be understood that -1, 0 and 1 are used to
represent ternary logic values in Table 1, and "-" in Table 1 can represent -1, and "+" can represent +1.
After the ternary logic values are added in pairs, Table 2 in FIG. 1B can be understood as a pull up switching map, which shows the partial results where the summed
results are logic value increases. Table 3 in FIG. 1B can be understood as a pull down switching map, which shows the partial results where the summed results are logic
value decreases.
Step 2, optimize the expression to determine the minimum number of transistors and the lowest delay in the ternary logic circuit.

Step 3: Select the best sum of products (SOP).
Step 4: Transistor mapping to obtain a ternary logic circuit.
After the transistor mapping of Table 2, the circuit for increasing the logic value can be shown as Circuit 1 in FIG. 1B. After the transistor mapping of Table 3, the circuit
for decreasing the logic value can be shown as Circuit 2 in FIG. 1B. It should be understood that, taking the addition calculation of ternary signal A and ternary signal B as
an example, in Circuit 1 and Circuit 2, A represents ternary signal A, B represents ternary signal B, AN represents ternary signal A after being processed by negative ternary
inverter (NTI), AP represents ternary signal A after being processed by positive ternary inverter (PTI), BN represents ternary signal B after being processed by NTI, and BP
represents ternary signal B after being processed by PTI.
Although this scheme can realize a ternary logic addition circuit, the design of a ternary logic circuit based on the truth table of ternary logic has the disadvantages of
complex structure, large number of transistors, large circuit delay and power consumption, and low computing performance. The specific details of this scheme can be
referred to the content of the prior art "A logic synthesis methodology for low-power ternary logic circuits".
In summary, how to design a ternary logic circuit with a simple structure and a small number of transistors is crucial. As the basic unit of the ternary logic circuit, the
design of the ternary logic gate circuit is crucial. The current ternary logic gate circuits are all based on adding and multiplying input signals, and directly designing
ternary logic gate circuits (as shown in FIG. 1B ), and there is no design scheme for ternary logic gate circuits. It should be understood that when the structure of the
ternary logic circuit is simple and the number of transistors is small, the circuit delay of the ternary logic circuit is small, the power consumption is small, and the
computing performance is high.
It should be understood that in circuit design, the single variable function f(x) is a means of realizing digital functions and is widely used. In three-valued logic, the
variable x of the single variable function f(x) has three values: 0, 1, and 2, that is, x∈{0,1,2}. It should be noted that in the following embodiments, the logic values in the
three-valued logic include "0, 1, and 2" as an example.
The output value of the univariate function f(x) is different for different values of x. When x=0, the output value of f(x) is C0, C0=f(0); when x=1, the output value of f(x) is
C1, C1=f(1); when x=2, the output value of f(x) is C2, C2=f(2). C0∈{0,1,2}, C1∈{0,1,2}, C2∈{0,1,2}. According to the design principles of multi-valued logic circuits, there
are 3 3 = 27 three-valued logic single-variable functions. The output values C0, C1 and C2 of these single-variable functions at x = 0, x = 1, and x = 2 are arranged in
ascending order according to the size of the ternary three-digit numbers C0, C1, and C2, namely f0, f1, f2, f3, f4, f5, f6, f7, f8, f9, f10, f11, f12, f13, f14, f15, f16, f17, f18, f19,
f20, f21, f22, f23, f24, f25, and f26.
Among them, f0={0,0,0}, f1={0,0,1}, f2={0,0,2}, f3={0,1,0}, f4={0,1,1}, f5={0,1,2}, f6={0,2,0}, f7={0,2,1}, f8={0,2,2}, f9={1,0,0}, f10={1,0,1}, f11={1,0,2}, f12={1,1,0},
f13={1,1, 1}, f14={1,1,2}, f15={1,2,0}, f16={1,2,1}, f17={1,2,2}, f18={2,0,0}, f19={2,0,1}, f20= {2,0,2}, f21={2,1,0}, f22={2,1,1}, f23={2,1,2}, f24={2,2,0}, f25={2,2,1}, f26=
{2,2,2}.
Based on the ternary logic single variable function, any input and output can be represented by the ternary logic single variable function, so the embodiment of the
present application designs a ternary logic gate circuit, which is used to implement the addition and subtraction of the input logic value. Based on the ternary logic gate
circuit, the embodiment of the present application uses 27 single variable functions of the ternary logic and applies the ternary logic gate circuit to the ternary logic circuit
on a large scale, which can achieve the purpose of simplifying the structure of the ternary logic circuit, reduce the number of transistors in the ternary logic circuit, reduce
the power consumption of the ternary logic circuit, and improve the calculation efficiency of the ternary logic circuit.
The following is a description of the ternary logic gate circuit, ternary logic calculation circuit (calculation circuit), chip and electronic device provided in the embodiments
of the present application in conjunction with specific embodiments. The following embodiments can be combined with each other, and the same or similar concepts or
processes may not be repeated in some embodiments.
An embodiment of the present application provides a ternary logic gate circuit. Referring to FIG. 2A , the ternary logic gate circuit 20 includes: a first voltage module 21
and a logic gate module 22 .
Among them, the first voltage module 21 is used to output a first voltage. Specifically, the first voltage module 21 is used to output a first voltage to the logic gate module
22. The first voltage is used to represent a first logic value, and the first logic value is any logic value in a ternary logic value. Exemplarily, the first logic value is any of the
following: 0, 1, 2. In some embodiments, the first logic value can be any of the following: -1, 0, 1. In the embodiment of the present application, the ternary logic value
includes "0, 1, 2" as an example for explanation.
In some embodiments, the mapping relationship between the first voltage and the first logic value can be preset. For example, when the first voltage is a value A, the first
voltage represents a first logic value of 0, when the first voltage is a value B, the first voltage represents a first logic value of 1, and when the first voltage is a value C, the
first voltage represents a first logic value of 2. For example, when the first voltage is 0V (value A), the first voltage represents a first logic value of 0, when the first voltage
is 0.5V (value B), the first voltage represents a first logic value of 1, and when the first voltage is 1V, the first voltage represents a first logic value of 2.
In some embodiments, the first voltage may also be regarded as the first level. Exemplarily, a mapping relationship between the first level and the first logic value may be
preset. For example, a low level represents a first logic value of 0, a medium level represents a first logic value of 1, and a high level represents a first logic value of 2. The
low level, the medium level, and the high level may be preconfigured.
The logic gate module 22 is used to receive the first voltage from the first voltage module 21 and output a second voltage. The second voltage is used to represent a
second logic value, and the second logic value is equal to the first logic value plus 1, or the second logic value is equal to the first logic value minus 1. In other words, in
the embodiment of the present application, the logic gate module 22 can realize adding 1 or subtracting 1 to the first logic value.
In some embodiments, the logic gate module 22 may be composed of a plurality of transistors. For example, when the logic gate module 22 receives a first voltage, the
first transistor among the plurality of transistors may be controlled to be turned on, enabling the logic gate module 22 to output a second voltage, and the second logic
value represented by the second voltage is equal to the first logic value plus 1. For example, when the logic gate module 22 receives a first voltage, the second transistor
among the plurality of transistors may be controlled to be turned on, enabling the logic gate module 22 to output a second voltage, and the second logic value
represented by the second voltage is equal to the first logic value minus 1. The first transistor may include some transistors among the plurality of transistors, the second
transistor may include some transistors among the plurality of transistors, and the first transistor is different from the second transistor.
In some embodiments, the logic gate module 22 may include a first voltage adjustment unit and a second voltage adjustment unit. Exemplarily, for example, when the
logic gate module 22 receives a first voltage, the first voltage adjustment unit may be turned on and the second voltage adjustment unit may be turned off, and the first
voltage adjustment unit may adjust the first voltage to a second voltage, and the second logic value represented by the second voltage is equal to the first logic value
plus 1. Exemplarily, for example, when the logic gate module 22 receives a first voltage, the second voltage adjustment unit may be turned on and the first voltage
adjustment unit may be turned off, and the second voltage adjustment unit is used to adjust the first voltage to a second voltage, and the second logic value represented

by the second voltage is equal to the first logic value minus 1. In some embodiments, the first voltage adjustment unit may be composed of a capacitor and/or a resistor,
and the second voltage adjustment unit may be composed of a capacitor and/or a resistor.
The ternary logic gate circuit provided in the embodiment of the present application can realize the addition or subtraction of the input first logic value, that is, the ternary
logic gate circuit can realize the self-increment or self-decrement of the logic value. Among them, the self-increment can represent the first logic value plus 1, and the
self-decrement can represent the first logic value minus 1.
In some embodiments, referring to FIG. 2B , the logic gate module 22 includes a pre-processing unit 221 , a first processing unit 222 , and a second processing unit 223 .
The first voltage module 21 is used to output the first voltage to the preprocessing unit 221 and the first processing unit 222. Accordingly, the preprocessing unit 221 can
receive the first voltage from the first voltage module 21, and the first processing unit 222 can receive the first voltage from the first voltage module 21.
After receiving the first voltage, the pre-processing unit 221 may output a third voltage to the first processing unit 222. The third voltage is used to represent a third logic
value, and the third logic value is 0 or 2.
In some embodiments, the preprocessing unit 221 may be composed of at least one transistor, or the preprocessing unit 221 may be composed of a voltage adjustment
unit. After receiving the first voltage, the preprocessing unit 221 may output a third voltage after processing the first voltage by the transistor therein. Alternatively, after
receiving the first voltage, the preprocessing unit 221 may adjust the first voltage to a third voltage by the voltage adjustment unit and output the third voltage.
The first processing unit 222 may receive the first voltage from the first voltage module 21 and the third voltage from the pre-processing unit 221. The first processing
unit 222 may output a fourth voltage to the second processing unit 223. The fourth voltage is used to represent a fourth logic value, and the fourth logic value is 0 or 2.
In some embodiments, the first processing unit 222 may be composed of at least one transistor, or the first processing unit 222 may be composed of a voltage
adjustment unit. After receiving the first voltage and the third voltage, the first processing unit 222 may output a fourth voltage after processing the first voltage and the
third voltage by the transistors therein. Alternatively, after receiving the first voltage and the third voltage, the voltage adjustment unit of the first processing unit 222 may
adjust the voltage to the fourth voltage and output the fourth voltage.
The second processing unit 223 can receive the fourth voltage from the first processing unit 222 and output the second voltage.
In some embodiments, the second processing unit 223 may be composed of at least one transistor, or the second processing unit 223 may be composed of a voltage
adjustment unit. After receiving the fourth voltage, the second processing unit 223 may output the second voltage after processing the fourth voltage by the transistor
therein. Alternatively, after receiving the fourth voltage, the voltage adjustment unit may adjust the fourth voltage to the second voltage and output the second voltage.
In the embodiment of the present application, a pre-processing unit 221 , a first processing unit 222 , and a second processing unit 223 are provided in the logic gate
module 22 , so as to achieve the purpose of adding 1 or subtracting 1 to the first logic value.
In the embodiment of the present application, 27 single-variable functions of three-valued logic are used to design a ternary logic gate circuit. In order to further solve the
problems of a large number of transistors and high power consumption in the ternary logic circuit in the prior art, the first processing unit 222 and the second processing
unit 223 in the embodiment of the present application can also be composed of transistors. This facilitates a clear comparison with the current ternary logic gate circuit.
The ternary logic circuit provided in the embodiment of the present application has a small number of transistors, low power consumption, and high computing
performance.
In some embodiments, the first processing unit 222 includes: a first group of transistors and a second group of transistors. The second processing unit 223 includes a
third group of transistors. In some embodiments, the first group of transistors may include at least one transistor, the second group of transistors may include at least
one transistor, and the third group of transistors may include at least one transistor.
The first voltage module 21 is connected to the preprocessing module 221, some transistors in the first group of transistors, and transistors in the second group of
transistors, respectively. In this way, the first voltage module 21 can output the first voltage to the preprocessing module 221 and the first processing unit 222 (e.g., some
transistors in the first group of transistors, and transistors in the second group of transistors), respectively.
The preprocessing module 221 is connected to the remaining transistors in the first group of transistors, and the transistors in the third group of transistors are
connected to the transistors in the first group of transistors and the transistors in the second group of transistors. In this way, when the preprocessing module 221
outputs the third voltage, it can output the third voltage to the first processing unit 222 (for example, the remaining transistors in the first group of transistors). The first
processing unit 222 can output the fourth voltage to the second processing unit 223 (for example, the third group of transistors).
In some embodiments, the first group of transistors, the second group of transistors, and the third group of transistors may be transistors of the same or different types,
such as insulated gate bipolar transistors (IGBT), metal-oxide-semiconductor field effect transistors (MOS), etc.
In some embodiments, the transistors in the first group of transistors, the second group of transistors, and the third group of transistors may be carbon nanotube field
effect transistors (CNTFETs). In the embodiments of the present application, in the ternary logic gate circuit, the power consumption of the ternary logic gate circuit may
be further reduced by avoiding the use of devices with high power consumption such as resistors and using CNTFETs instead.
The threshold voltage (Vth) of CNTFET is related to the diameter of CNT, and the diameter of CNT depends on the chirality vector. Therefore, by changing the diameter or
chirality vector of CNT, the threshold voltage of CNTFET can be controlled. It should be understood that the threshold voltage of a transistor refers to: the voltage that
enables the transistor to turn on. Among them, when the voltage difference between the gate and the source (or drain) of the transistor is greater than or equal to the
threshold voltage of the transistor, the transistor is turned on, and when the voltage difference between the gate and the source (or drain) of the transistor is less than the
threshold voltage of the transistor, the transistor is turned off (or in a cut-off state).
In some embodiments, the threshold voltages of transistors in the first group of transistors, the second group of transistors, and the third group of transistors may be the
same.
In some embodiments, the threshold voltages of transistors in the first group of transistors, the second group of transistors, and the third group of transistors may be
different. Exemplarily, the threshold voltage of transistors in the first group of transistors is a first threshold voltage, the threshold voltage of transistors in the second
group of transistors is a second threshold voltage, and the threshold voltage of transistors in the third group of transistors 2223 is a third threshold voltage. The first
threshold voltage is less than or equal to the first threshold, the third threshold voltage is greater than the first threshold and less than or equal to the second threshold,
and the first threshold is less than the second threshold. Exemplarily, for example, the first threshold may be 0.35V, and the second threshold may be 0.5V. The first
threshold voltage may be set to 0.2V-0.3V, the third threshold voltage may be set to 0.4V, and the second threshold voltage may be set to 0.6V-0.7V.
In some embodiments, the transistors in the first group of transistors can be called low threshold voltage (low Vthreshold, LVT) transistors, the transistors in the second
group of transistors can be called high threshold voltage (high V threshold, HVT) transistors, and the transistors in the third group of transistors 2221 can be called

middle threshold voltage (middle V threshold) transistors.
In the embodiments of the present application, there is no restriction on the specific values of the first threshold voltage, the second threshold voltage, and the third
threshold voltage. The first threshold voltage, the second threshold voltage, and the third threshold voltage may be related to the voltage output by the second voltage
module. The first threshold voltage, the second threshold voltage, the third threshold voltage, and the second voltage module may refer to the description in the following
embodiments.
The following describes the principle that a ternary logic gate circuit can realize the addition of 1 to a first logic value or the subtraction of 1 to a first logic value with
reference to a specific example:
Example 1: The ternary logic gate circuit can realize the first logic value plus 1, that is, the second logic value is equal to the first logic value plus 1.
In some embodiments, the pre-processing module 221 is a negative ternary inverter (NTI). The first group of transistors includes: a first transistor L1, a second transistor
L2 and a third transistor L3, the second group of transistors includes: a fourth transistor H1 and a fifth transistor H2, and the third group of transistors includes: a sixth
transistor M1 and a seventh transistor M2.
In some embodiments, the first group of transistors, the second group of transistors, and the third group of transistors may be transistors of the same or different
polarities, and the polarities may include N-type and P-type. In some embodiments, the first transistor L1, the second transistor L2, the fourth transistor H1, and the sixth
transistor M1 are P-type transistors, and the third transistor L3, the fifth transistor H2, and the seventh transistor M2 are N-type transistors.
In some embodiments, the ternary logic gate circuit may further include a second voltage module, and the second voltage module may provide a fifth voltage (V DD ) for
the logic gate module 22 .
In some embodiments, the first voltage module 21 and the second voltage module may not be included in the ternary logic gate circuit, wherein the ternary logic gate
circuit may receive the first voltage from the first voltage module 21 and the fifth voltage from the second voltage module.
Referring to a in FIG3 , the first voltage module 21 is connected to the gate of the first transistor L1, the gate of the fourth transistor H1, and the gate of the fifth transistor
H2, respectively, and NTI is connected to the gate of the second transistor L2 and the gate of the third transistor L3, respectively. The source of the first transistor L1 is
connected to the second voltage module, the drain of the first transistor L1 is connected to the source of the second transistor L2, the drain of the second transistor L2 is
connected to the source of the third transistor L3 and the source of the sixth transistor M1, respectively, and the drain of the third transistor L3 is grounded. The gate of

The source of the fourth transistor H1 is connected to the second voltage module, the drain of the fourth transistor H1 is connected to the source of the fifth transistor
H2 and the source of the seventh transistor M2 respectively, the drain of the fifth transistor H2 is grounded, and the gate of the seventh transistor M2 is connected to the
second voltage module.
It should be understood that in a in FIG. 3 , GND represents grounding, in represents output, out represents output, and V DD represents the second voltage module.
In the embodiment of the present application, because the second voltage module can provide the fifth voltage (V DD ) for the logic gate module 22, and the ground
voltage is V GND , it can be understood that the highest voltage input to the logic gate module 22 is V DD , and the lowest voltage is V GND . In order to reflect that the first
voltage output by the first voltage module represents any logic value in the ternary logic value, in some embodiments, when the first voltage is equal to V DD , the first
voltage represents the first logic value 2. The first voltage can be set to be equal to The first voltage represents a first logic value of 1. When the first voltage is set to be

0.7V), so the fourth transistor H1 is turned off.
Similarly, the voltage at the drain of the fifth transistor H2 is equal to V GND because the voltage at the gate of the fifth transistor H2 is Therefore, the voltage difference
between the gate and drain of the fifth transistor H2 is (eg, 0.5V), and because the fifth transistor H2 is an N-type transistor, the voltage difference between the gate and

connected to the second voltage module, the voltage of the gate of the seventh transistor M2 is V DD , and the voltage difference between the gate and the source of the
seventh transistor M2 is V DD (e.g., 1V). Since the seventh transistor M2 is an N-type transistor, the voltage difference between the gate and the source of the seventh
transistor M2 is greater than the third threshold voltage of the seventh transistor M2, and therefore the seventh transistor M2 is turned on.
According to the same analysis idea, when the sixth transistor M1 and the seventh transistor M2 are turned on, a second voltage V GND can be output, and the second
voltage represents a second logic value of 0. Specifically, because the first transistor L1 and the third transistor L3 are turned off, the second transistor L2 and the sixth
transistor M1 are isolated outside the circuit and have no effect on the ternary logic gate circuit. At this time, the output of the ternary logic gate circuit relies on H2 and
M2 to output V GND , thereby realizing the function of adding 1 to the first logic value.

transistor L1, and the first transistor L1 is turned off.
For the third transistor L3, the gate of the third transistor L3 is The voltage of the drain of the third transistor L3 is V GND , and the voltage difference between the gate and
drain of the third transistor L3 is (eg 0.5V), and because the third transistor L3 is an N-type transistor, the voltage difference between the gate and the drain of the third

difference between the gate and the source of the fourth transistor H1 is (e.g. -0.5V), and because the fourth transistor H1 is a P-type transistor, the absolute value of the
voltage difference between the gate and the source of the fourth transistor H1 (e.g. 0.5V) is less than the second threshold voltage of the fourth transistor H1 (e.g. 0.6V-
0.7V), so the fourth transistor H1 is turned off.
Similarly, for the fifth transistor H2, the voltage of the gate of the fifth transistor H2 is The voltage of the drain of the fifth transistor H2 is equal to V GND , and the voltage

For the first transistor L1, the first voltage (V DD ) can output a third voltage V GND after passing through PTI, the voltage of the gate of the first transistor L1 is V GND , the
voltage of the source of the first transistor L1 is V DD , the voltage difference between the gate and the source of the first transistor L1 is V GND -V DD (e.g. -1V), and
because the first transistor L1 is a P-type transistor, the absolute value of the voltage difference between the gate and the source of the first transistor L1 (e.g. 1V) is
greater than the first threshold voltage of the first transistor L1, and the first transistor L1 is turned on.
For the third transistor L3, the voltage of the gate of the third transistor L3 is V DD , the drain of the third transistor L3 is grounded, the voltage difference between the gate
and the drain of the third transistor L3 is V DD , and because the third transistor L3 is an N-type transistor, the voltage difference between the gate and the source of the

voltage (V DD ) can output the third voltage V GND after passing through PTI. The gate voltage of the second transistor L2 is V GND . The voltage difference between the
gate and the source of the second transistor L2 is 0V. Because the second transistor L2 is an N-type transistor, the voltage difference between the gate and the source of

Wherein, after the second transistor L2 is turned off, the third transistor L3 is isolated and does not affect the output of the ternary gate circuit.
When the first transistor L1 is turned on, the voltage at the source of the seventh transistor M2 is equal to V GND . Since the gate of the seventh transistor M2 is
connected to the second voltage module, the voltage at the gate of the seventh transistor M2 is V DD . Moreover, since the seventh transistor M2 is an N-type transistor,
the voltage difference between the gate and the source of the seventh transistor M2 is greater than the third threshold voltage of the seventh transistor M2 , and the
seventh transistor M2 is turned on.
Similarly, for the fourth transistor H1, the voltage of the gate of the fourth transistor H1 is V DD , the voltage of the source of the fourth transistor H1 is V DD , the voltage
difference between the gate and the source of the fourth transistor H1 is 0V, and because the fourth transistor H1 is a P-type transistor, the absolute value of the voltage
difference between the gate and the source of the fourth transistor H1 is less than the second threshold voltage of the fourth transistor H1, and therefore the fourth
transistor H1 is turned off.
The voltage of the gate of the fifth transistor H2 is V DD , and the voltage of the drain of the fifth transistor H2 is equal to V GND . Therefore, the voltage difference between
the gate and the drain of the fifth transistor H2 is V DD −V GND (e.g., 1V), and because the fifth transistor H2 is an N-type transistor, the voltage difference between the
gate and the source of the fifth transistor H2 is greater than the second threshold voltage of the fifth transistor H2 , and thus the fifth transistor H2 is turned on.
When the fifth transistor H3 is turned on, the voltage at the source of the sixth transistor M1 is equal to V DD . Since the gate of the sixth transistor M1 is grounded, the
voltage at the gate of the sixth transistor M1 is V GND . The voltage difference between the gate and the source of the sixth transistor M1 is V GND -V DD (e.g. -1V). Since
the sixth transistor M1 is a P-type transistor, the absolute value of the voltage difference between the gate and the source of the sixth transistor M1 (1V) is greater than
the third threshold voltage of the sixth transistor M1. Therefore, the sixth transistor M1 is turned on.

54, the second gate tube 55, and the third gate tube 56. The second signal module is respectively connected with the first gate tube 54, the first ternary logic gate circuit
52, and the second ternary logic gate circuit 53. The first ternary logic gate circuit 52 is connected with the second gate tube 55, and the second ternary logic gate circuit
53 is connected with the third gate tube 56.
The second signal module is used to output a second signal. When the second signal passes through the first ternary logic gate circuit 52, the first ternary logic gate
circuit 52 can add 1 to the logic value corresponding to the second signal. When the second signal passes through the second ternary logic gate circuit 53, the second
ternary logic gate circuit 53 can subtract 1 from the logic value corresponding to the second signal. When the second signal does not pass through the first ternary logic
gate circuit 52 and the second ternary logic gate circuit 53, the logic value corresponding to the second signal can be output.
The first signal module is used to output the first signal. The signal processing module 51 is used to turn on any gate tube according to the first signal to enable the
summing circuit to output the first summation result of the first signal and the second signal.
The first signal and the second signal are both ternary signals, for example, the first signal is used to represent the fifth logic value, and the second signal is used to
represent the sixth logic value. In some embodiments, the first signal module can output the first signal in the form of an output voltage or a level, and the second signal
module can also output the second signal in the form of an output voltage or a level, and the description of the first voltage module outputting the first voltage can be
referred to.
In some embodiments, when the signal processing module 51 turns on the first gate tube 54 according to the first signal, the first summation result is: the sum of the
fifth logic value and the sixth logic value. When the signal processing module 51 turns on the second gate tube 55 according to the first signal, the first summation result
is: the sum of the sixth logic value plus 1 and the fifth logic value. When the signal processing module 51 turns on the third gate tube 56 according to the first signal, the
first summation result is: the sum of the sixth logic value minus 1 and the fifth logic value. In this way, the summation circuit 50 can output the first summation result of
the first signal and the second signal.
In some embodiments, referring to FIG. 5 , the signal processing module 51 may include: a first NTI 511 , a second NTI 512 , a PTI 513 , and a NOR gate 514 .

NTI can be regarded as the output end of the NTI, the first end of the PTI can be regarded as the input end of the PTI, and the second end of the PTI can be regarded as
the output end of the PTI.
The following takes the case where the first signal is a ternary signal A and the second signal is a ternary signal B as an example to illustrate the process in which the
summing circuit 50 outputs the first summing result SUM AB :
When the ternary signal A passes through the first NTI 511, the first NTI 511 can output the A0 signal. When the ternary signal A passes through the PTI 513 and the
second NTI 512, the second NTI 512 can output the A2 signal. When the A0 signal and the A2 signal pass through the NOR gate 514, the NOR gate 514 can output the A1
signal.
The A0 signal is used to turn off or turn on the first gate tube 54. The A1 signal is used to turn off or turn on the second gate tube 55. The A2 signal is used to turn off or
turn on the third gate tube 56.
In some embodiments, the gate tube is composed of two transistors with opposite polarities. Specifically, the gate tube is composed of an N-type transistor and a P-type
transistor connected back to back. The back-to-back connection of the N-type transistor and the P-type transistor can be understood as: the source of the N-type
transistor is connected to the drain of the P-type transistor, the drain of the N-type transistor is connected to the source of the P-type transistor, or the source of the N-
type transistor is connected to the source of the P-type transistor, and the drain of the N-type transistor is connected to the drain of the P-type transistor.
Taking the ternary signal A representing the fifth logic value 2 as an example, the ternary signal A can output an A2 signal through the PTI 513 and the second NTI 512,
and the A2 signal represents the logic value 2. The A2 signal can turn on the third selection tube, so that the summing circuit can output the first summation result of "the
sum of the sixth logic value minus 1 and the fifth logic value".
Taking the ternary signal A representing the fifth logic value 1 as an example, the A1 signal output by the NOR gate 514 can turn on the second selection tube, so that the
summing circuit can output the first summing result of "the sum of the sixth logic value plus 1 and the fifth logic value".
Taking the ternary signal A representing the fifth logic value 0 as an example, the ternary signal A can output the A0 signal through the first NTI 511, and the A0 signal
represents the logic value 2. The A0 signal can turn on the first selection tube, so that the summing circuit can output the first summation result of "the sum of the fifth
logic value and the sixth logic value".
An embodiment of the present application provides a summing circuit, which can perform a summing calculation on a ternary signal A and a ternary signal B and output
a first summing result.
In the above summation circuit, the summation calculation of the ternary signal A and the ternary signal B can be realized, but based on the calculation principle of the
ternary summation, there is a carry when the summation calculation of the ternary signal A and the ternary signal B is performed. In order to ensure the accuracy of the
summation calculation, the embodiment of the present application provides a half-adder circuit based on the summation circuit. The half-adder circuit adds a carry
device on the basis of the summation circuit, and can more accurately perform the summation calculation of the ternary signal A and the ternary signal B.

Fig. 6. In the enlarged view of the first carry 61, An indicates that the first signal is output to the first carry 61 after being processed by NTI, and Ap indicates that the first
signal is output to the first carry 61 after being processed by PTI. Bn indicates that the second signal is output to the first carry 61 after being processed by NTI, and BP
indicates that the second signal is output to the first carry 61 after being processed by PTI.
The summing circuit 50 is used to output a first summation result of the first signal and the second signal, and the first summation result is represented by SUM AB in
Figure 6. In some embodiments, SUM AB can also be referred to as the sum of halfadder circuit 60.

In some embodiments, the structure of the second-stage half-adder circuit 71 may be the same as the structure of the first-stage half-adder circuit 60 , as shown in FIG. 6

In some embodiments, in the second-stage half adder, since the carry after the sum of the first signal and the second signal can only be a logic value 0 or a logic value 1,
and a logic value 2 will not appear, in the second-stage half adder, the calculation path only needs to perform a +0 operation (such as using a buffer) or a +1 operation
(such as using a self-increment logic gate circuit), without using a self-decrement logic gate circuit.
In some embodiments, the second-stage half-adder circuit 71 may include a third ternary logic gate circuit, in which the second logic value output by the third ternary

PTI processing. Out indicates the output (Carry) of the second carry, and half V DD indicates V DD /2.
As shown in FIG. 10 , the second carry device 72 is composed of a plurality of low voltage threshold transistors of different polarities, wherein the voltage threshold of the

In the embodiment of the present application, a summing circuit can be designed based on a self-increasing logic gate circuit and a self-decrementing logic gate circuit,
and a half-adding circuit can be designed based on the summing circuit. Based on the first-stage half-adding circuit, a full-adding circuit that can sum three ternary
signals is designed, with a small number of transistors, low power consumption, and high computing efficiency.
In some embodiments, the present application also provides a multiplication circuit, which includes the summing circuit 50 in the above embodiment and the half-adding
circuit 60 in the above embodiment. The summing circuit 50 and the half-adding circuit 60 provided in the embodiment of the present application are applied to a larger-
scale ternary multiplication circuit, and the number of transistors in the ternary multiplication circuit is small, the power consumption is small, and the calculation
efficiency is high.
Taking the 2trit*2trit multiplication circuit as an example, a in FIG11 shows an existing ternary multiplication circuit. Referring to a in FIG11 , the current ternary
multiplication circuit needs to use 4 multipliers TMul, two summing circuits, and two full-adding circuits. If the summing circuit and the full-adding circuit use the
summing circuit and the full-adding circuit in the current prior art, the number of transistors in the multiplication circuit is large and the calculation efficiency is low.
In some embodiments, the summing circuit 50 and the full adder circuit 70 provided in the embodiment of the present application can be used in a in FIG. 11 , which can
reduce the number of transistors in the multiplication circuit to a certain extent and improve the calculation efficiency of the multiplication circuit. It should be understood
that a in FIG. 11 represents the summing circuit with Tsum (ternary Sum), represents the full adder circuit with TFA (ternary full adder), and TMul represents the 1trit
multiplier.
In some embodiments, in order to further reduce the number of transistors in the multiplication circuit, the idea of approximate multiplication calculation can be used in
the embodiments of the present application. Approximate multiplication calculation can exchange higher computing performance and lower power consumption at the
cost of smaller calculation errors. The basic scheme of 1trit ternary approximate calculation multiplication is shown in Figure 12 below. With reference to Figure 12, it can
be seen that the carry C of 1trit ternary multiplication calculation is 1 only when and only when input A and input B are both 2, and the carry is 0 in all other cases. If this
approximate scheme is adopted to perform approximate calculation on the case where input A=B=2, the carry can be ignored in all cases in the circuit.
In some embodiments, the multiplication circuit may include: a summing circuit 50, a half-adding circuit 60, a multiplier, and an approximate multiplier. In the
embodiments of the present application, based on the idea of approximate multiplication calculation, some multipliers in the current ternary multiplication circuit may be
replaced with approximate multipliers, which can reduce the number of transistors in the multiplication circuit.
The multiplier is used to output a first multiplication result. The approximate multiplier is used to output a second multiplication result, which can be understood as a
multiplication result obtained by approximate multiplication calculation. The summation circuit and the half-addition circuit are used to output a third multiplication result
according to the first multiplication result and the second multiplication result.

In order to facilitate comparison with the current ternary multiplication circuit, taking a 2trit*2trit multiplication circuit as an example, b in FIG. 11 shows the multiplication
circuit provided in an embodiment of the present application.
11 b , the multiplication circuit 1100 may include a multiplier 1101 , a first approximate multiplier 1102 , a second approximate multiplier 1103 , a third approximate
multiplier 1104 , a summing circuit 60 , a first half-addition circuit 50 , and a second half-addition circuit 50 .
It should be understood that the structures of the first half-adder circuit 50 and the second half-adder circuit 50 are the same, and reference can be made to the
description of the half-adder circuit 50 in the above embodiment. In b of FIG. 11 , the inputs respectively include “A 0 and B 0 ”, “A 1 and B 0 ”, “A 0 and B 1 ”, and “A 1 and B
1 ” as an example, and A 0 , B 0 , A 1 , and B 1 are all ternary signals. In some embodiments, “A 0 and B 0 ” can be referred to as the first group of ternary signals, “A 1 and B
0 ” can be referred to as the second group of ternary signals, “A 0 and B 1 ” can be referred to as the third group of ternary signals, and “A 1 and B 1 ” can be referred to as
the fourth group of ternary signals.
In addition, in b in Figure 11, the summation circuit 60 is represented by Tsum (ternary Sum), the first half adder circuit 50 is represented by THA 1 (ternary half adder),
the second half adder circuit 50 is represented by THA 2, the 1trit multiplier is represented by TMul, the first approximate multiplier is represented by ATMul 1, the second
approximate multiplier is represented by ATMul 2, and the third approximate multiplier is represented by ATMul 3.
The first approximate multiplier ATMul 1 can perform multiplication calculation on the first group of ternary signals and output a first sub-multiplication result, such as P
0.
The second approximate multiplier ATMul 2 can perform multiplication calculation on the second group of ternary signals and output the second sub-multiplication result
to the first half adder circuit THA1. The third approximate multiplier ATMul 3 can perform multiplication calculation on the third group of ternary signals and output the
third sub-multiplication result to the first half adder circuit THA1. The first half adder circuit THA1 can output a fourth sub-multiplication result P1 according to the second
sub-multiplication result and the third sub-multiplication result, and output a fifth sub-multiplication result to the second half adder circuit THA2.
The multiplier TMul can perform multiplication calculation on the fourth group of ternary signals and output the first multiplication result to the second half adder circuit
THA2. The second half adder circuit THA2 is used to output the sixth sub-multiplication result P2 according to the fifth sub-multiplication result and the first multiplication
result, and output the seventh sub-multiplication result to the summing circuit Tsum.
The summing circuit Tsum is used to output an eighth sub-multiplication result P 2 according to the first multiplication result and the seventh sub-multiplication result.
Among them, for the third multiplication result output by the summation circuit and the half-addition circuit, the third multiplication result may include: a first sub-
multiplication result, a fourth sub-multiplication result, a sixth sub-multiplication result and an eighth sub-multiplication result.
The multiplication circuit provided in the embodiment of the present application can be applied to any scenario requiring ternary multiplication calculation.
In some embodiments, because the multiplication circuit in the embodiment of the present application is based on the idea of approximate multiplication, the
multiplication circuit provided by the embodiment of the present application can be used in scenarios where precise calculation is not required (such as artificial
intelligence neural network algorithms). Among them, the multiplication circuit provided by the embodiment of the present application based on approximate
multiplication calculation can effectively reduce the complexity of the circuit and realize new high-efficiency and low-power algorithm acceleration applications.
In some embodiments, in order to reduce the calculation error of the multiplication circuit, an additional compensation unit may be added to the multiplication circuit. As
shown in b of FIG. 13 , the multiplication circuit may include a first compensation unit, which may implement a +6 operation. As shown in c of FIG. 13 , the multiplication
circuit may include a second compensation unit, which may implement a +9 operation. It should be understood that a of FIG. 13 shows the multiplication circuit shown in
b of FIG. 11 , and ATMul 1, ATMul2, ATMul 3, TFA 1, and TFA 2 are not marked in FIG. 13 , and reference may be made to b of FIG. 11 .
In addition, FIG13 shows the relative error and absolute error of each multiplication circuit when performing multiplication calculation.
In the embodiment of the present application, an additional compensation unit is added to the multiplication circuit to implement the +6 or +9 operation, which can
effectively reduce the calculation error of the multiplication circuit, and the hardware cost is only the addition of a new addition module. Because the "+9" operation is
equivalent to the P2 bit +1 in the ternary system, and the "+6" operation is equivalent to the P1 bit +2 in the ternary system, the first compensation unit and the second
compensation unit can be implemented by a summation circuit or a full addition circuit.
In some embodiments, multiple 2trit*2trit ternary multiplication circuits may be cascaded to further expand the multiplication circuit to realize a larger-scale
multiplication circuit. For example, a 6trit*6trit ternary multiplication circuit is taken as an example in the embodiments of the present application.
Referring to Figure 14, for the ternary input signals A and B of 6trit, we group A and B into 2 bits, and we can get A[5:4], A[3:2], A[1:0], and B[5:4], B[3:2], B[1:0] respectively.
By performing multiplication operations with 2trit as the basic unit, we can get multiple groups of partial products such as P00=A[1:0]*B[1:0], P01=A[3:2]*B[1:0],
P10=A[1:0]*B[3:2], etc., and then sum these partial products in a weighted manner (the summation process uses the exact calculation mode) to get the approximate
calculation result of the ternary multiplication of 6trit*6trit.
It should be understood that the 6trit*6trit ternary multiplication circuit is taken as an example in the embodiment of the present application. It can be imagined that the
multiplication circuit provided in the embodiment of the present application can be applied to circuit designs of larger scale and arbitrary scale, and all belong to the
protection scope of the embodiment of the present application.
For example, if A is 379 and B is 537 in decimal, then A×B=203523. If A and B are expressed in ternary, A can be expressed as 112001 and B can be expressed as
201220.
a in Figure 15 shows the process of calculating A×B using the current multiplication circuit (such as a in Figure 11), and b in Figure 15 shows the process of calculating
A×B using the multiplication circuit provided in the embodiment of the present application (such as b in Figure 11). The multiplication result obtained by multiplying A and
B by the multiplication circuit provided in the embodiment of the present application has a small error.
In some embodiments, the present application provides a chip, which may include any of the following: a first ternary logic gate circuit, a second ternary logic gate circuit,
a summing circuit 50, a half-adding circuit 60, a full-adding circuit 70, and a multiplication circuit 1100. In some embodiments, the chip may be referred to as a first chip.
In some embodiments, the present application provides a chip, which may include at least one of the following: a summing circuit 50, a half-adding circuit 60, a full-
adding circuit 70, and a multiplication circuit 1100. In some embodiments, the chip may be referred to as a second chip.
In some embodiments, an embodiment of the present application provides an electronic device, which may include a first chip or a second chip.
