DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0015] The following disclosure provides different embodiments, or examples, for implementing different features of the provided subject matter. Specific examples of
components and arrangements are described below to simplify the present disclosure. These are, of course, merely examples and are not intended to be
limiting. For example, the formation of a first feature over a second feature in the description that follows may include embodiments in which the first and
second features are formed in direct contact, and may also include embodiments in which additional features are disposed between the first and second
features, such that the first and second features are not in direct contact. In addition, the present disclosure may repeat reference numerals and/or letters in the
various examples. This repetition does not in itself dictate a relationship between the various embodiments and/or configurations discussed.
[0016] Spatially relative terms, such as “beneath,” “below,” “lower,” “above,” “upper” and the like, may be used herein for ease of description to describe one element or
feature's relationship to another element(s) or feature(s) as illustrated in the figures. The spatially relative terms are intended to encompass different
orientations of the device in use or operation in addition to the orientation depicted in the figures. The apparatus may be otherwise oriented (rotated 90 degrees
or at other orientations) and the spatially relative descriptors used herein may likewise be interpreted accordingly.
[0017] The term “nominal” as used herein refers to a desired, or target, value of a characteristic or parameter for a component or a process operation, set during the
design phase of a product or a process, together with a range of values above and/or below the desired value. The range of values is typically due to slight
variations in manufacturing processes or tolerances.
[0018] In some embodiments, the terms “about” and “substantially” can indicate a value of a given quantity that varies within 5% of the value (e.g., ±1%, ±2%, ±3%, ±4%,
±5% of the value). These values are merely examples and are not intended to be limiting. The terms “about” and “substantially” can refer to a percentage of the
values as interpreted by those skilled in relevant art(s) in light of the teachings herein.
[0019] The present disclosure provides methods for forming example complimentary metal-oxide-semiconductor (CMOS) devices. The methods can also be applied
towards forming any suitable semiconductor structures, such as gate-all-around (GAA) field effect transistors (FETs), fin-type FET (finFETs), horizontal or vertical
GAA finFETs, and planar FETs. An example of a FET is a metal oxide semiconductor field effect transistor (MOSFET). MOSFETs can be, for example, (i) planar
structures built in and on the planar surface of a substrate, such as a semiconductor wafer or (ii) built with vertical structures. The term “FinFET” refers to a FET
formed over a fin that is vertically oriented with respect to the planar surface of a wafer. The term “vertical,” as used herein, means nominally perpendicular to the
surface of a substrate.
[0020] The performance and scalability of current silicon-based transistors is reaching fundamental limits despite the implementation of various enhancement
techniques, such as novel device architectures for enhanced electrostatic control, transport enhancement by strained channels, improved dopant activation, and
parasitic resistance reduction. As device dimensions are scaled down to achieve higher packing density, it has been a challenge to shrink silicon-based
transistors.
[0021] Two-dimensional (2D) materials are monolayers of materials held together by chemical bonds and can be used in a variety of applications to increase
performance. For example, 2D materials can be implemented in semiconductor devices, electrodes, water purification devices, and photovoltaic devices.
Individual 2D monolayers can be stacked on each other to form a stack of 2D material layers, and the thickness of the stack of 2D material layers can be varied
by stacking different numbers of individual monolayers. The stack of 2D materials can be used to form channel regions in semiconductor transistor devices to
reduce device footprint and improve device performance. Implementing 2D materials in semiconductor devices can be achieved by a thin film transfer process
that can include attaching a monolayer of 2D material to a carrier film, removing the monolayer of 2D material from a host wafer, and placing it on a
semiconductor substrate for further fabrication operations. Since the 2D material monolayer has atomic-level thickness, maintaining a high level of cleanliness
of the 2D material monolayer is critical for achieving high device performance and yield. However, by-products of various fabrication processes and transfer
processes can leave undesirable residue on monolayers of 2D material, especially on larger areas of 2-inch and 3-inch wafers. Applying cleaning processes to
remove the interfacial contamination can cause damage to the surface of the 2D material monolayer. For example, adsorbates such as water and hydrocarbons
can cover the surfaces of 2D material. Cleaning processes, including dry plasma etching, wet etching, and annealing, can increase surface roughness or etch
through the monolayers, while etch by-products can remain on the surface after the cleaning processes. In addition, solvent cleaning processes can also leave
residue on the surface of the monolayers.
[0022] Various embodiments in the present disclosure describe methods for forming semiconductor devices incorporating substantially residue-free 2D materials (e.g.,
2D materials with no residue). Layers of 2D material can be stacked together via van der Waals force and transferred onto a substrate. In some embodiments,
interfaces between each monolayer of 2D material can be substantially free of residue (e.g., no residue). In some embodiments, top and bottom surfaces of the
layer stack can also be substantially free of residue. In some embodiments, a first monolayer of 2D material is attached to a second monolayer of 2D material
via van der Waals force to form a van der Waals heterostack. The stack can be attached to a carrier layer (e.g., a polymer film) and transferred to a substrate for
further processing. Additional monolayers of 2D materials can be added to the heterostack by performing additional attaching and wafer-scale transferring
processes. Using van der Waals force to form a heterostack of 2D materials can provide the benefit of, among other things, substantially residue-free surfaces
and intact layers after transfer. In addition, adhesives are not needed for bonding the layers of 2D material together during the wafer-scale transferring process.
[0023] FIG. 1 is a flow diagram of a method 100 for forming a heterostack including 2D materials, according to some embodiments. For illustrative purposes, the
operations illustrated in FIG. 1 will be described with reference to the example fabrication process illustrated in FIGS. 2-5 . Operations can be performed in a
different order or not performed depending on specific applications. It should be noted that method 100 may not produce a complete semiconductor device.
Accordingly, it is understood that additional processes can be provided before, during, and after method 100, and that some other processes may only be briefly
described herein. The transfer process described in FIGS. 2-5 can be performed in a processing chamber under vacuum without exposing the structures to an
ambient environment, which can provide the benefit of preventing surface oxidation and contaminants adsorption that in turn increases the magnitude of van
der Waals force at the interfaces. In some embodiments, the vacuum level can be maintained between about 1×10−3 Torr and about 1×10−5 Torr.
[0024] Referring to FIG. 1 , in operation 102, a first monolayer of 2D material is deposited on a substrate, according to some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 2 , a first
monolayer 206 is deposited on substrate 201. In some embodiments, various structures are collectively referred to as a substrate for simplicity. For example,
substrate 201 can include a bulk substrate 202 and a metal layer 204. Bulk substrate 202 can be a carrier wafer and formed using suitable materials, such as an
elementary semiconductor, a compound semiconductor, an alloy semiconductor, and any suitable materials. For example, bulk substrate 202 can be formed
using silicon, silicon oxide, sapphire, silicon nitride, titanium nitride, silicon germanium, any suitable material, and combinations thereof. Metal layer 204 can be
formed using a suitable metal material, such as copper. In some embodiments, nickel, gold, copper, ruthenium, tungsten, silver, cobalt, any suitable metal, and
combinations thereof can be used to form metal layer 204. Because the deposition process can be performed in a deposition chamber maintained under
vacuum without exposing the substrate or deposited film to ambient, a top surface of first monolayer 206 can be substantially residue free after the deposition
process.
[0025] First monolayer 206 of a 2D material can be deposited on metal layer 204. In some embodiments, first monolayer 206 can be deposited directly on bulk
substrate 202. In some embodiments, first monolayer 206 can be formed using a suitable 2D material, such as a hexagonal boron nitride (h-BN) material. First
monolayer 206 can be deposited using suitable deposition methods, such as (i) atomic layer deposition (ALD); (ii) chemical vapor deposition (CVD), such as low
pressure CVD (LPCVD), atomic layer CVD (ALCVD), ultrahigh vacuum CVD (UHVCVD), reduced pressure CVD (RPCVD), and any other suitable CVD; (iii) molecular
beam epitaxy (MBE) processes; (iv) any suitable epitaxial process; and (v) a combination thereof. A thickness t of first monolayer 206 can be the thickness of a
monolayer of 2D material. For example, first monolayer 206 formed using h-BN material can have a thickness t of about 0.33 nm. In some embodiments,
thickness t can be between about 0.30 nm and about 0.36 nm. In some embodiments, thickness t can be between about 0.2 nm and about 0.8 nm.
[0026] Referring to FIG. 1 , in operation 104, a second monolayer of 2D material is attached to the first monolayer of 2D material, according to some embodiments. As
shown in FIG. 3A, a second monolayer 310 is attached to first monolayer 206. In some embodiments, a carrier film can be attached to second monolayer 310
https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230307234A1/en

US20230307234A1 - Semiconductor device with two-dimensional materials - Google Patents
prior to the attachment process. For example, carrier film 312 can be attached to a top surface of second monolayer 310. In some embodiments, carrier film 312
can be a polymer layer and adhered to second monolayer 310. In some embodiments, carrier film 312 can be formed using polymethyl methacrylate (PMMA),
polyvinyl alcohol (PVA), polypropylene carbonate (PPC), polystyrene (PS), any suitable polymer material, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments,
carrier film 312 can be attached to second monolayer 310 by depositing a polymer material on second monolayer 310 and removing the second monolayer 310
from a carrier substrate.
[0027] In some embodiments, second monolayer 310 can be formed using transition metal dichalcogenides (TMDs). Suitable TMDs can be denoted as MX2, where M
denotes a transition metal element and X denotes a chalcogen element. For example, the transition metal element can be molybdenum or tungsten. In some
embodiments, the chalcogen element can be one of sulfur, selenium, or tellurium. In some embodiments, other suitable TMD materials can be used. Thickness
of second monolayer 310 can be the thickness of a monolayer of the 2D material. For example, thickness of second monolayer 310 formed using molybdenum
disulfide can have a thickness of about 0.65 nm. In some embodiments, thickness of second monolayer 310 can be between about 0.45 nm and about 1.2 nm.
[0028] First and second monolayers 206 and 310 can be attached to each other through van der Waals force. The attaching process can be performed in a vacuum
environment (e.g., a vacuum chamber) to avoid impurity or moisture contamination at the interface that may degrade the van der Waals force. An optional
external force 314 can be applied to a top surface of carrier film 312 after first and second monolayers 206 and 310 have come into physical contact to ensure
that the contact is uniform throughout the entire interface between the two monolayers. In some embodiments, the external force can result in a pressure of
about 60 N/in2 and about 1600 N/in2 at the interfaces between surfaces. Pressure greater than 1600 N/in2 may cause physical damage to the films while
pressure less than about 60 N/in2 may be insufficient for increasing the van der Waals bond strength. The attaching process can be performed in a vacuum
environment, such as a processing chamber maintained under vacuum. In some embodiments, the vacuum level can be maintained between about 1×10−3 Torr
and about 1×10−5 Torr to increase the magnitude of van der Waals force at the interface. The interface between first and second monolayers 206 and 310 can
be substantially residue free because carrier film 312 or other structures are not in contact with first monolayer 206.
[0029] Although first monolayer 206 and carrier film 312 illustrated in FIG. 3A are not in physical contact with each other, the edges of first monolayer 206 and carrier
film 312 can be sealed together to protect second monolayer 310 during the transfer process and prevent exposure to contamination. In addition, sealing the
edges can also enhance the structural integrity of the stacked layers (formed of carrier film and monolayers) during the transfer process. To seal the film edges
prior to the wafer-scale transferring process, surface areas of first monolayer 206 and carrier film 312 can both be greater than a surface area of second
monolayer 310. For example, first monolayer 206 can be have a circular area with a diameter about 2 inches, and second monolayer 310 can have a circular area
with a diameter less than 2 inches, such as between about 1.7 inches and about 1.9 inches. Carrier film 312 can have a diameter that is between about 2.1
inches and about 2.5 inches.
[0030] Due to the surface area difference, portions of first monolayer 206 and carrier film 312 that are not in contact with second monolayer 310 can also overlap with
each other. For example, as shown in FIG. 3B which illustrates enlarged view 301 of the edge regions of the stacked layers, perimeter portions 312A of carrier
film 312 and perimeter portions 206A of first monolayer 206 can be deformed under the application of force 314 and be in physical contact with each other,
sealing second monolayer 310 after the physical contact. In some embodiments, physically contacting first monolayer 206 and carrier film 312 can lead to the
formation of chemical bonds or other attaching mechanisms at the interface of the aforementioned films, therefore increasing the structural integrity of the
stacked layers. The width of overlapping perimeter portions 312A and 206A can be greater than about 0.5 mm to ensure a secure seal that can maintain its
structural integrity during the transfer process.
[0031] Referring to FIG. 1 , in operation 106, the first monolayer is separated from the substrate, according to some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 4 , heterostack
formed of first monolayer 206 and second monolayer 310 are separated from substrate 201 at the interface of first monolayer 206 and metal layer 204. To
achieve separation only at the interface of first monolayer 206 and metal layer 204 while keeping the heterostack intact, an electrochemical delamination
process can be used. The stack of layers including substrate 201 can be submerged into an aqueous solution of sodium hydroxide (NaOH). A DC voltage can be
applied to the layer stack by using metal layer 204 as a cathode and a platinum (Pt) foil that is formed on top of carrier film 312 as the anode. In some
embodiments, the applied DC voltage can be between about 3 V and about 5 V. For example, the applied DC voltage can be about 4 V. During the electrochemical
delamination process, first monolayer 206 can be detached from metal layer 204 by the generation of hydrogen gas formed at the interface of first monolayer
206 and metal layer 204. First monolayer 206 and second monolayer 310 can be held together by van der Waals force during the electrochemical delamination
process and subsequently transferred to other suitable substrates. In some embodiments, other suitable separation process can be used.
[0032] Referring to FIG. 1 , in operation 108, the first monolayer is attached to another substrate, according to some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 5 , a heterostack
501 formed of first and second monolayers 206 and 310 can be attached to another substrate 502 for use in additional fabrication processes. In some
embodiments, substrate 502 can be a 4-inch wafer formed using silicon or silicon oxide. In some embodiments, substrate 502 can be a wafer having any
suitable diameter. For example, substrate 502 can be a wafer having a diameter between about 2 inches and about 12 inches. In some embodiments, a bottom
surface of first monolayer 206 can be attached to a top surface of substrate 502 via suitable attachment mechanisms, such as van der Waals bonding, chemical
bonding, adhesives, any suitable bonding methods, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, carrier film 312 can be removed using suitable methods,
such as dry etching processes, wet etching processes, ashing processes, any suitable removal processes, and combinations thereof In some embodiments,
residue may remain on a top surface of second monolayer 310 as a result of the carrier film removal process and/or subsequent processes, but the interface
between first and second monolayers 206 and 310 can be protected without being exposed and remain substantially residue free.
[0033] FIG. 6 is a flow diagram of a method 600 for forming a heterostack including 2D materials, according to some embodiments. For illustrative purposes, the
operations illustrated in FIG. 6 will be described with reference to the example fabrication process as illustrated in FIGS. 7-10 . Operations can be performed in a
different order or not performed depending on specific applications. It should be noted that method 600 may not produce a complete semiconductor device.
Accordingly, it is understood that additional processes can be provided before, during, and after method 600, and that some other processes may only be briefly
described herein. Similar elements in FIGS. 7-10 and FIGS. 2-5 are labelled with the same annotations for simplicity. The transfer process described in FIGS. 7-10
can be performed in a processing chamber under vacuum without exposing the structures to an ambient environment, which can provide the benefit of
preventing surface oxidation and contaminants adsorption that in turn increases the magnitude of van der Waals force at the interface. In some embodiments,
the vacuum can be maintained between about 1×10−3 Torr and about 1×10−5 Torr.
[0034] Referring to FIG. 6 , in operation 602, a first monolayer of 2D material is deposited on a substrate, according to some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 7 , first
monolayer 206 can be deposited on substrate 201. In some embodiments, first monolayer 206 can be deposited on metal layer 204. Similar to first monolayer
206 described in FIG. 2 , first monolayer 206 described in FIG. 7 can be formed using an h-BN material. In some embodiments, first monolayer 206 can be
deposited directly on bulk substrate 202. First monolayer 206 can be deposited using any suitable deposition methods, such as ALD and CVD.
[0035] Referring to FIG. 6 , in operation 604, a carrier film and a hard mask layer are attached to a second monolayer of 2D material, according to some embodiments.
As shown in FIG. 7 , a bottom surface of hard mask 711 can be attached to a top surface of second monolayer 310. Additionally, a carrier film 712 can be
attached to a top surface of hard mask 711. In some embodiments, second monolayer 310 described in FIG. 7 and second monolayer 310 can be formed using
similar materials. For example, second monolayer 310 can be formed using TMDs. Suitable TMDs can be denoted as MX2, where M denotes a transition metal
element and X denotes a chalcogen element. Since second monolayer 310 is formed of a 2D material having atomic level thickness, hard mask 711 can provide
additional mechanical support for second monolayer 310 to increase its structural integrity during fabrication processes and also protect it from chemical
reactions during the formation and removal of carrier film 712. In some embodiments, hard mask 711 can be formed of aluminum oxide, silicon nitride, silicon
oxide, any suitable dielectric material, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, hard mask 711 can be deposited using ALD, CVD, PVD, any suitable
deposition methods, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, carrier film 712 can be similar to carrier film 312 described in FIG. 3 and is not described

in detail herein for simplicity. In some embodiments, surface areas of carrier film 712 and first monolayer 206 can be greater than surfaces areas of second
monolayer 310 and hard mask 711. External force 714 can be applied to the top surface of carrier film to increase the bonding uniformity and the strength of the
van der Waals bond. Force 714 can be similar to force 314 described in FIG. 3A and is not described in detail herein for simplicity.
[0036] Referring to FIG. 6 , in operation 606, the second monolayer of 2D material is attached to the first monolayer of 2D material and the first monolayer is separated
from the substrate, according to some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 8 , a bottom surface of second monolayer 310 is attached to a top surface of first
monolayer 206. In some embodiments, the aforementioned surfaces are attached via van der Waals bonding, forming a heterostack 701 that includes a pair of
2D material films of first and second monolayers 206 and 310, respectively. First monolayer 206 can be separated from substrate 201 by performing a
electrochemical delamination process similar to the separation process described in FIG. 4 . In addition, similar to the sealing process described in FIG. 3B, the
perimeter regions of carrier film 712 and first monolayer 206 can be pressed and sealed together to protect second monolayer 310 that is enclosed in between.
[0037] Referring to FIG. 6 , in operation 608, the first monolayer of 2D material is attached to another substrate, according to some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 9 ,
bottom surface of first monolayer 206 is attached to a substrate 902 such that heterostack 701 can be prepared for additional fabrication processes. In some
embodiments, substrate 902 can be a substrate, a semiconductor device, or any suitable semiconductor structure. In some embodiments, substrate 902 can be
a 4-inch wafer formed using silicon or silicon oxide. In some embodiments, after attaching first monolayer 206 to substrate 902, carrier film 712 can be removed
using a removal process. For example, a polymer remover or a wet chemical etch can be used to remove carrier film 712 and exposing underlying hard mask
711. Residue may remain on the top surface of hard mask 711, but the top surface of second monolayer 310 can be protected by hard mask 711 during the
removal process of carrier film 712 and remain substantially free of residue.
[0038] Referring to FIG. 6 , in operation 610, the hard mask layer is removed from the top surface of the second monolayer of 2D material, according to some
embodiments. As shown in FIG. 10 , hard mask 711 can be removed to expose the underlying second monolayer 310. Hard mask 711 can be removed using dry
plasma etching, wet chemical etching, any suitable etching processes, and combinations thereof. The top surface of second monolayer 310 can be substantially
free of residue after the removal process of hard mask 711 because second monolayer 310 can be inert to the etching processes used to remove hard mask
711. For example, compared to organic polymer carrier films, hard mask 711 can leave less residue on second monolayer 310 after being removed.
[0039] FIG. 11 is a flow diagram of a method 1100 for forming a heterostack including 2D materials, according to some embodiments. For illustrative purposes, the
operations illustrated in FIG. 11 will be described with reference to the example fabrication process as illustrated in FIGS. 12-15 . Operations can be performed in
a different order or not performed depending on specific applications. It should be noted that method 1100 may not produce a complete semiconductor device.
Accordingly, it is understood that additional processes can be provided before, during, and after method 1100, and that some other processes may only be
briefly described herein. Similar elements in FIGS. 12-15 and FIGS. 2-5 are labelled with the same annotations for simplicity. The transfer process described in
FIGS. 12-15 can be performed in a processing chamber under vacuum without exposing the structures to an ambient environment, which can provide the benefit
of preventing surface oxidation and contaminants adsorption that in turn increases the magnitude of van der Waals force at the interface. In some
embodiments, the vacuum can be maintained between about 1×10−3 Torr and about 1×10−5 Torr.
[0040] Referring to FIG. 11 , in operation 1102, a first monolayer of 2D material can be deposited on a substrate, according to some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 12 ,
first monolayer 1206 can be deposited on substrate 1202. In some embodiments, first monolayer 1206 can be formed using TMDs. Suitable TMDs can be
denoted as MX2, where M denotes a transition metal element and X denotes a chalcogen element. For example, the transition metal element can be
molybdenum or tungsten. In some embodiments, the chalcogen element can be one of sulfur, selenium, or tellurium. In some embodiments, other suitable TMD
materials can be used. First monolayer 1206 can be deposited using ALD, LPCVD, ALCVD, UHVCVD, RPCVD, MBE, any suitable epitaxial process, and
combinations thereof. In some embodiments, substrate 1202 can be similar to substrate 202 described in FIG. 2 and is not described in detail here for simplicity.
[0041] Referring to FIG. 11 , in operation 1104, a second monolayer of 2D material is attached to the first monolayer of 2D material, according to some embodiments. A
bottom surface of a second monolayer 1210 can be attached to a top surface of first monolayer 1206. First and second monolayers 1206 and 1210 can be
attached together by van der Waals bonding to form a heterostack. Additionally, a carrier film 1212 can be attached to a top surface of second monolayer 1210.
In some embodiments, second monolayer 1210 can be formed using a 2D material, such as h-BN. In some embodiments, second monolayer 1210 can be

different 2D materials. For example, first monolayer 1206 can be formed using molybdenum disulfide, and second monolayer 1210 can be formed using h-BN.
First and second monolayers 1206 and 1210 can be attached using van der Waals bonding. In some embodiments, a carrier film 1212 can be attached to a top
surface of second monolayer 1210. Carrier film 1212 can be a polymer layer formed using PMMA, PVA, PPC, PS, any suitable polymer material, and
combinations thereof. In some embodiments, carrier film 1212 can be similar to carrier film 312 described in FIGS. 3A and 3B and is not described in detail
herein for simplicity. In some embodiments, an external force 1214 can be used to increase the bonding uniformity and strength. External force 1214 can be
similar to force 314 and is not described in detail herein for simplicity.

embodiments. As shown in FIG. 13 , first monolayer layer 1206 can be separated from substrate 1202. In some embodiments, first monolayer 1206 can be
removed from substrate 1202 using a detaching process, such as a thermal release process, a laser release process, an ultra-violet (UV) treatment process, a
chemical strip process, any suitable removal process, and/or combinations thereof. In some embodiments, perimeter regions of carrier film 1212 and first
monolayer 1206 can be bonded together, and the bonding strength can be sufficient to support mechanically detaching first monolayer 1206 from substrate
1202. In some embodiments, first monolayer 1206 can be formed on a metal layer of substrate 1202, and an electrochemical delamination process can be used
for the detaching process.
[0043] First monolayer 1206 can be attached to third monolayer 1322 formed of 2D materials. In some embodiments, third monolayer 1322 can be formed using h-BN.
In some embodiments, third monolayer 1322 can be formed using a suitable 2D material, such as a TMD layer. In some embodiments, first and third monolayers
1206 and 1322 are formed using different 2D materials. In some embodiments, first monolayer 1206 and third monolayer 1322 can be attached to each other
using van der Waals bonding. In some embodiments, an external force 1314 can be used to improve bonding uniformity at interfaces. For example, force 1314
can be similar to force 314. In some embodiments, a surface area of first monolayer 1206 can be greater than a surface area of second monolayer 1210, and
the bonding process can include physically bonding perimeter regions of first monolayer 1206 and carrier film 1212 to protect enclosed second monolayer
1210. The interface between first and second monolayer layers 1206 and 1210 as well as the interface between first monolayer 1206 and third monolayer 1322
can be substantially free of residue since these interfaces are enclosed and not exposed to contaminants during the transfer process. A heterostack 1401
includes first, second, and third monolayers 1206, 1210, and 1322 that are held together by van der Waals bonding processes as described above in FIGS. 12
and 13 .
[0044] Referring to FIG. 11 , in operation 1108, the third monolayer is separated from the substrate, according to some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 14 , third
monolayer 1322 can be separated from substrate 1302. Third monolayer 1322 can be separated from substrate 1302 by pulling carrier film 1212 in a direction
away from substrate 1302. In some embodiments, separating third monolayer 1322 from substrate 1302 can be similar to the process of separating first
monolayer 1202 from substrate 1202 and is not described in detail here for simplicity.
[0045] Referring to FIG. 11 , in operation 1110, the third monolayer is attached to a substrate and the carrier film is removed, according to some embodiments. As
shown in FIG. 15 , third monolayer 1322 of heterostack 1401 can be attached to a top surface of substrate 1502. In some embodiments, substrate 1502 can be
similar to substrate 202 described in FIG. 2 . In some embodiments, substrate 1502 can include one or more additional layers and suitable semiconductor
devices, which are not illustrated in FIG. 15 for simplicity. For example, substrate 1502 can include one or more non-active devices and logic devices embedded
therein. In some embodiments, substrate 1502 can be a 4-inch wafer formed using silicon or silicon oxide. Carrier film 1212 can be removed after heterostack

suitable removal process, and combinations thereof.
[0046] FIG. 16 is a flow diagram of a method 1600 for forming a heterostack including 2D materials, according to some embodiments. For illustrative purposes, the
operations illustrated in FIG. 16 will be described with reference to the example fabrication process as illustrated in FIGS. 17-21 . Operations can be performed in
a different order or not performed depending on specific applications. It should be noted that method 1600 may not produce a complete semiconductor device.
Accordingly, it is understood that additional processes can be provided before, during, and after method 1600, and that some other processes may only be
briefly described herein. Similar elements in FIGS. 17-21 and FIGS. 2-5 are labelled with the same annotations for simplicity. The transfer process described in
FIGS. 17-21 can be performed in a processing chamber under vacuum without exposing the structures to an ambient environment, which can provide the benefit
of preventing surface oxidation and contaminants adsorption that in turn increases the magnitude of van der Waals force at the interface. In some
embodiments, the vacuum can be maintained between about 1×10−3 Torr and about 1×10−5 Torr.
[0047] Referring to FIG. 16 , in operation 1602, a first monolayer of 2D material can be deposited on a substrate, according to some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 17 ,
first monolayer 1706 can be deposited on substrate 1702. In some embodiments, first monolayer 1706 can be formed using TMDs. Suitable TMDs can be
denoted as MX2, where M denotes a transition metal element and X denotes a chalcogen element. For example, the transition metal element can be
molybdenum or tungsten. In some embodiments, the chalcogen element can be one of sulfur, selenium, or tellurium. In some embodiments, other suitable TMD
materials can be used. First monolayer 1706 can be deposited using ALD, LPCVD, ALCVD, UHVCVD, RPCVD, MBE, any suitable epitaxial process, and
combinations thereof. In some embodiments, first monolayer 1706 can be similar to first monolayer 1206 described in FIG. 12 . In some embodiments,
substrate 1702 can be similar to substrate 202 described in FIG. 2 and is not described in detail here for simplicity.
[0048] Referring to FIG. 16 , in operation 1604, a second monolayer of 2D material is attached to the first monolayer of 2D material, according to some embodiments. A
bottom surface of a second monolayer 1710 can be attached to a top surface of first monolayer 1706. First and second monolayers 1706 and 1710 can be
attached together by van der Waals bonding to form a heterostack. In some embodiments, second monolayer 1710 can be formed using a 2D material, such as
h-BN. In some embodiments, second monolayer 1710 can be formed using any suitable 2D material, such as TMD materials. In some embodiments, first and
second monolayers 1706 and 1710 can be formed using different 2D materials. For example, first monolayer 1706 can be formed using molybdenum disulfide
and second monolayer 1710 can be formed using h-BN. Additionally, a hard mask 1711 can be formed on a top surface of second monolayer 1710. Hard mask
1711 can be formed using a material similar to that of hard mask 711. For example, hard mask 1711 can be formed of aluminum oxide material and deposited
using ALD. A carrier film 1712 can be attached to a top surface of hard mask 1711. Carrier film 1712 can be similar to carrier film 312 and formed using a
polymer material, such as PMMA, PVA, PPC, PS, any suitable polymer material, and combinations thereof. In some embodiments, an external force 1714 that is
similar to force 314 can be applied to improve bonding uniformity between the bonding interfaces. In some embodiments, perimeter regions of carrier film 1712
and first monolayer 1706 can be bonded together using a process similar to that of carrier film 312 and first monolayer 206 described in FIG. 3B and is not
described in detail herein for simplicity.
[0049] Referring to FIG. 16 , in operation 1606, the first monolayer can be separated from the substrate and attached to a third monolayer to form a heterostack of 2D
materials, according to some embodiments. Separating first monolayer 1706 from substrate 1702 can be achieved by pulling carrier film 1712 in a direction
away from substrate 1702. The separation process can be similar to that of separating first monolayer 1206 from substrate 1202 and is not described in detail
herein for simplicity.
[0050] After first monolayer 1706 is separated from substrate 1702, first monolayer 1706 can be attached to third monolayer 1822 formed of 2D materials. In some
embodiments, third monolayer 1822 can be formed using h-BN. In some embodiments, third monolayer 1822 can be formed using a suitable 2D material, such
as a TMD layer. In some embodiments, first and third monolayers 1706 and 1822 are formed using different 2D materials. In some embodiments, first monolayer
1706 and third monolayer 1822 can be attached to each other using van der Waals bonding. In some embodiments, an external force 1814 can be used to
improve bonding uniformity at interfaces. For example, force 1814 can be similar to force 314.
[0051] In some embodiments, a surface area of first monolayer 1706 can be greater than a surface area of second monolayer 1710, and the bonding process can
include physically bonding perimeter regions of first monolayer 1706 and carrier film 1712 to protect enclosed second monolayer 1710. The interface between
first and second monolayer layers 1706 and 1710, as well as the interface between first monolayer 1706 and third monolayer 1822, can be substantially free of
residue since these interfaces are enclosed and not exposed to contaminants during the transfer process. A heterostack 1801 can include first, second, and
third monolayers 1806, 1810, and 1822 that are held together by van der Waals bonding processes as described in FIGS. 17 and 18 .
[0052] Referring to FIG. 16 , in operation 1608, the third monolayer is separated from the substrate, according to some embodiments. As shown in FIG. 19 , third
monolayer 1822 can be separated from substrate 1802. Third monolayer 1822 can be separated from substrate 1802 by pulling carrier film 1712 in a direction
away from substrate 1802. The separation process can be similar to the separation process described in FIGS. 12 and 14 and is not described in detail herein for
simplicity.
[0053] Referring to FIG. 16 , in operation 1610, the third monolayer is attached to a substrate and the carrier film is removed, according to some embodiments. As
shown in FIG. 20 , third monolayer 1822 of heterostack 1801 can be attached to a top surface of substrate 1902. In some embodiments, substrate 1902 can be
similar to substrate 202 described in FIG. 2 . In some embodiments, substrate 1902 can include one or more additional layers and suitable semiconductor
devices and are not illustrated in FIG. 20 for simplicity. Carrier film 1712 can be removed after heterostack 1801 is transferred onto a top surface of substrate
1902. Carrier film 1712 can be removed using dry plasma etching, wet chemical etching, ashing process, any suitable removal process, and combinations
thereof.
[0054] Referring to FIG. 16 , in operation 1612, the hard mask layer is removed from the top surface of the second monolayer, according to some embodiments. As
shown in FIG. 21 , hard mask 1711 can be removed to expose the underlying second monolayer 1810. Hard mask 1711 can be removed using dry plasma
etching, wet chemical etching, any suitable etching processes, and combinations thereof. The removal process of hard mask 1711 can be similar to the removal
process described in FIG. 10 and is not described in detail herein for simplicity.
[0055] FIGS. 22A, 22B, and 23 described exemplary additional fabrication processes after the heterostack has been formed as described in FIGS. 1-21 . FIGS. 22A and
22B are respective plan and cross-sectional views of a carrier film 2220 formed on heterostack 1801 and substrate 1902 of FIG. 21 . The cross-sectional view
illustrated in FIG. 22B is viewed from plane A-A′ of FIG. 22A. Other suitable structures can be formed and are not illustrated in FIGS. 22A and 22B for simplicity.
Carrier film 2220 can be used to transfer heterostack 1801 to other substrates for further processing.
[0056] As shown in FIGS. 22A and 22B, carrier film 2220 can be formed on the top surface of heterostack 1801. For example, carrier film 2220 can be formed on the
top surface of second monolayer 1710. In addition, carrier film 2220 can also be deposited into heterostack 1801. For example, a carrier film grid 2221 can
extend vertically (e.g., z direction) through first, second, and third monolayers 1706, 1710, and 1822. The term “vertical,” as used herein, means nominally
perpendicular to the surface of a substrate. Carrier film grid 2221 can be formed by etching a plurality of trenches in heterostack 1801 and depositing a carrier
film material in the trenches until the trenches are completely filled. In some embodiments, carrier film grid 2221 and carrier film 2220 can be formed using the
same material, such as a polymer material. The deposition of carrier film material can continue until carrier film 2220 is formed on the top surface of second
monolayer 1710. Implementing carrier film grid 2221 can improve the structural integrity of the heterostack 1801 during a transfer process. Carrier film 2220
and carrier film grid 2221 can be formed using materials and processes similar to those of carrier film 312 and are not described in detail herein for simplicity.
As shown in FIGS. 22A and 22B, carrier film grid 2221 can divide heterostack 1801 into an array of dies 2230, with each die including a heterostack of 2D
materials. In some embodiments, the boundary of each die of the array of dies 2230 can also align with semiconductor dies onto which the heterostack 1801
will be transferred. In some embodiments, carrier film grid 2221 can also be implemented in heterostacks 501, 701, and 1401 respectively described in FIGS. 5,
7, and 14 .

[0057] FIG. 23 illustrates a three-dimensional (3D) monolithic semiconductor structure incorporating semiconductor devices having heterostacks of 2D materials,
according to some embodiments. The heterostack of 2D materials can be transferred onto existing semiconductor devices using one or more of the transfer
processes described above in FIGS. 1-22B. Additional structures can be included in the structure illustrated in FIGS. 23 and are not illustrated for simplicity.
[0058] The 3D monolithic semiconductor structure illustrated in FIG. 23 can include a plurality of front-end-of-line (FEOL) structures 2300 and a plurality of back-end-of-
line (BEOL) structures 2320. Heterostack 1801 of FIGS. 21, 22A, and 22B can be transferred onto top surfaces of BEOL structures 2320 using carrier film 2220
and carrier film grid 2221 described in FIGS. 22A and 22B. After the transfer process, carrier film 2220 and carrier film grid 2221 can be removed by suitable
etching processes.
[0059] FEOL structures 2300 can include a plurality of transistors, such as transistors 2303 formed over a substrate 2302. Substrate 2302 can be similar to substrate
202 described in FIG. 2 and is not described in detail herein for simplicity. Transistors 2303 can include various types of transistor devices, such as a pair of n-
type and p-type metal-oxide-semiconductor (MOS) transistors. Transistors 2303 can include substrate 2301, a pair of source/drain region 2304, gate dielectric
layer 2305, spacers 2306, gate electrode 2307, and source/drain contacts 2308. Source/drain regions refer to the source and/or drain junctions that form two
terminals of a FET. Additional structures can be formed in transistors 2303 and are not illustrated in FIG. 23 for simplicity.
[0060] BEOL structures 2320 can include a plurality of interconnect structures formed in an interlayer dielectric (ILD) layer. For example, vias 2324 formed in ILD layer
2322 can be electrically and physically connected to source/drain contacts 2308 of FEOL structures 2300. Conductive lines 2326 formed in ILD layer 2322 can
be connected to one or more vias 2324 to provide lateral (e.g., x direction) electrical connection. Vias 2324 can also be connected to other structures formed
over BEOL structures 2320. In some embodiments, vias 2324 and conductive lines 2326 can be formed using copper, cobalt, aluminum, any suitable conductive
materials, and combinations thereof.
[0061] Semiconductor structures 2340 can be formed on BEOL structures 2320. Semiconductor structures 2340 can include transistors 2343 that incorporate
heterostacks of 2D materials. For example, heterostacks 1801 of FIGS. 22A and 22B can be transferred and placed on a top surface of ILD layer 2322 of BEOL
structures 2320. Heterostacks formed of multiple layers of 2D materials can be used as channel regions 2345 to improve the device performance of transistors
2343. Portions of heterostacks 1801 can be used as channel regions for transistors 2343. Although heterostack 1801 is illustrated in FIG. 23 , other
heterostacks can also be implemented in transistors 2343. For example, heterostacks 501, 701, and 1401 respectively described in FIGS. 5, 7, and 14 can also
be implemented in transistors 2343. Additional layers of 2D materials can be added using the wafer-scale transferring processes described in the present
disclosure until nominal thickness or electrical properties of the heterostack has been achieved. As shown in FIG. 23 , transistor devices 2343 can include a
channel region 2345 formed between source/drain regions 2348. Source/drain regions 2348 can be formed using a conductive material, such as copper and
doped silicon. In some embodiments, channel regions 2345 can be formed using dies 2230 formed in heterostack 1810 by carrier film grid 2221 described in
FIGS. 22A and 22B. Transistor devices 2343 can also include gate dielectric layers 2345, spacers 2346, and gate electrode 2347. Additional structures can also
be included in transistor devices 2343 and are not illustrated for simplicity. For example, one or more work function layers can be formed between gate dielectric
layer 2345 and gate electrode 2347. Source/drain regions 2348 of transistors 2343 can be electrically connected to source/drain contacts 2308 of transistors
2303 through the interconnect structures formed in BEOL structures 2320. Source/drain regions 2348 can be formed by etching openings through ILD layer
2342 and heterostack 1801 and depositing conductive material in the openings. In some embodiments, the conductive material can include copper.
[0062] Various embodiments in the present disclosure describe methods for forming semiconductor devices incorporating substantially residue-free 2D materials.
Layers of 2D material can be stacked together via van der Waals force and transferred onto a substrate. A monolayer of 2D material is attached to another
monolayer of 2D material via van der Waals force to form a van der Waals heterostack. Additional monolayers of 2D materials can be added to the heterostack
by performing additional attaching and wafer-scale transferring processes. The stack can be attached to a carrier layer (e.g., a polymer film) and transferred to
other substrates or devices for further processing. Using van der Waals force to form a heterostack of 2D materials can provide the benefit of, among other
things, substantially residue-free surfaces and intact layers after transfer. In addition, adhesives is not needed for bonding the layers of 2D materials together
during the wafer-scale transferring process.
[0063] In some embodiments, a method includes forming a first two-dimensional (2D) layer on a first substrate and attaching a second 2D layer to a carrier film. The
method also includes bonding the second 2D layer to the first 2D layer to form a heterostack including the first and second 2D layers. The method further
includes separating the first 2D layer of the heterostack from the first substrate and attaching the heterostack to a second substrate. The method further
includes removing the carrier film from the second 2D layer.
[0064] In some embodiments, a method includes forming a first two-dimensional (2D) layer on a metal layer and depositing a hard mask layer on a second 2D layer. The
method also includes attaching a carrier film to the hard mask layer and bonding the second 2D layer to the first 2D layer to form a heterostack including the first
and second 2D layers. The method also includes separating the first 2D layer of the heterostack from the metal layer and attaching the heterostack to a second
substrate. The method further includes removing the carrier film and the hard mask layer from the second 2D layer.
[0065] In some embodiments, a method includes forming a first two-dimensional (2D) layer on a substrate and bonding a second 2D layer to the first 2D layer. The

Description
TECHNICAL FIELD
The present invention relates to the field of data communication and more particularly relates to a FPGA based system for decoding multi-level PAM-3 signals.
BACKGROUND
Over the last decade, the automotive industry has evolved rapidly. Modern automobiles use a plurality of Electronic Control Units (ECUs) that monitor and control the
various electronic components in the automobile. Typically, automobiles are loaded with various sensor-based comfort and safety features and sophisticated
applications to improve users' safety, fuel consumption and convenience. Typically, such features and applications rely on high bandwidth. The increasing use of ECUs in
automobiles and advanced signal processing is driving the need for high performance automotive communication networks. As a result, Ethernet standard has emerged
as the standard for automotive communications over other low speed protocols such as Local Interconnect Network (LIN) protocol, Controller Area Network (CAN)
protocol, FlexRay protocol, etc. Two variants of Ethernet protocol—100BASE-T1 and 1000BASE-T1 are currently being adopted in automotive communication networks.
The 100BASE-T1 and 1000BASE-T1 are developed to support 100 Mbps and 1 Gbps respectively and aimed at increasing data throughput, meeting strong automotive
emission standards, and reducing cabling weight and cost in automotive networking.
Particularly, the 100BASE-T1 variant uses full duplex connection between two ECUs using differential pair of wires for data transmission and uses PAM-3 signalling at the
Physical Layer (PHY). Due to this, signals from a master ECU and a slave ECU propagating in opposite directions overlay in the cable, resulting in a multi-level signal on
the cable. The master and slave ECUs can decode the data as both ECUs know the contribution of their own signal and are able to reconstruct the incoming signal out of
the sum. However, the full duplex transmission makes it difficult to probe the 100BASE-T1 line to decode the signal for test and analysis, and this is a major challenge
faced in designing test and measurement equipment such as, protocol analyzers. There are devices such as directional couplers which can separate the overlaid signals
between the ECUs and give them out on separate channels. However, the outputs of such devices are noisy and extensive signal processing might be needed to
reconstruct and decode the original PAM-3 signals.
SUMMARY
This summary is provided to introduce a selection of concepts in a simplified format that are further described in the detailed description of the invention. This summary
is not intended to identify key or essential inventive concepts of the subject matter, nor is it intended for determining the scope of the invention.

master device and the slave device, for separating the master and the slave signals, a pair of DVGAs configured for amplifying the master and slave signals to a specific
voltage range, a pair of ADCs configured for converting analog master and slave signals to digital master and slave signals, a FPGA module configured for processing
both the digital master and slave signals for extracting PAM-3 symbols. The FPGA module comprises, ADC interface modules configured for sampling and de-serializing

Embodiments of the present disclosure will be described below in detail with reference to the accompanying figures.
Embodiments of the present disclosure disclose a Field Programmable Gate Array (FPGA) based system for decoding three level Pulse Amplitude Modulated Signals
(PAM-3 signals), particularly for decoding 100BASE-T1 PAM-3 signals using a directional coupler and an Analog to Digital Converter (ADC). In other words, the present
disclosure discloses a FPGA based system for acquiring and decoding master and slave PAM-3 signals in real-time from a directional coupler. The proposed FPGA based
system uses master and a slave PAM-3 signal separated using a directional coupler as an input, decodes the PAM-3 signals, and provides decoded PAM-3 signals to a
100BASE-T1 protocol decoder for higher layer Ethernet protocol decoding.
FIG. 1 illustrates a FPGA based system for decoding 100BASE-T1 PAM-3 signals in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. The FPGA based system
100 may be implemented to probe the 100BASE-T1 line between the two devices D1 and D2 under test and for decoding the PAM-3 signals between them. The devices
under test (D1 and D2) may refer to Electronic Control Units (ECUs) of an automobile, which may be master and slave ECUs of the automobile. Hereinafter, D1 is referred
to as “master device D1” and D2 is referred to as “slave device D2”. As shown, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, the FPGA based system 100 comprises a
directional coupler 105, two Digital Variable Gain Amplifiers (DVGAs) 110 and 115, two Analog to Digital Converters (ADCs) 120 and 125, a Field Programmable Gate
Array (FPGA) module 130 and a Universal Serial Bus (USB) Controller 135.

US11405248B2 - FPGA based system for decoding PAM-3 signals - Google Patents
The directional coupler 105 is connected to the line (differential pair of wires) between the master device D1 and slave device D2 and the directional coupler 105 is
configured for separating the master and slave signals, that is, the signals transmitted by the master device D1 and the slave device D2. The output of the directional
coupler 105, that is, the master signals and the slave signals are fed to the two DVGAs 110 and 115 respectively as shown in FIG. 1. It is to be noted that the two
directional couplers may be used for separating the master and slave signals.
The DVGAs 110 and 115 are digitally controlled variable gain amplifiers that vary their gains depending on the register value programmed by the FPGA module 130. In
one embodiment of the present disclosure, the DVGAs 110 and 115 are configured for amplifying the input signals to the specified input voltage range of the ADCs 120
and 125. That is, since the outputs of the directional coupler 105 are low in amplitude, the DVGAs 110 and 115 are used in the front end to amplify the signals to the
specified input voltage range of ADCs 120 and 125. Referring to FIG. 1, DVGA 110 amplifies the master signals from the directional coupler 105 and the DVGA 115
amplifies the slave signals from the directional coupler 105. The amplified master and slave signals are then fed to ADCs 120 and 125 for further processing.
The ADCs 120 and 125 convert the analog input signals into digital signals. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the sampling rate of ADCs 120 and 125 is fixed
at 800 Msps (mega samples per second) which is approximately 12 times the data rate of 100BASE-T1 PAM-3 signal, which is 66.66 Mbps. This sampling rate is
selected for allowing enough samples per PAM-3 symbol time to decode the symbols correctly. Even though sampling rate of each ADC (120 and 125) is twelve times the
ideal data rate of 100BASE-T1 signal, the ADC's sampling is treated as asynchronous with respect to the 100BASE-T1 data rate (since each uses separate reference
clocks) and appropriate steps are followed in further modules to lock PAM-3 level sampling rate to the line data rate. Referring to FIG. 1, ADC 120 and ADC 125 sample
master signals and slave signals respectively. In one implementation, each ADC 120 and 125 uses Low Voltage Differential Signalling (LVDS) interface for sending
sampled data to the FPGA module 130.
As described, the master and the slave signals are derived from the differential pair of wires between the master device D1 and the slave device D2 using the directional
coupler 105, the derived signals are amplified using the two DVGAs 110 and 115, and the amplified signals are sampled at 800 Msps using the ADCs 120 and 125. Then
the output of ADCs 120 and 125, that is, the twelve times oversampled data is fed to the FPGA module 130 for extracting the PAM-3 symbols and sending the extracted
PAM-3 symbols to a computer having the appropriate software for higher layer protocol decoding. The manner in which the PAM-3 symbols are decoded from the
oversampled ADCs 120 and 125 data using a fully pipelined Register Transfer Level (RTL) logic in FPGA module 130 is described in detail further below.
FIG. 2 illustrates FPGA data flow for decoding PAM-3 symbols in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. In one implementation, the data from the
two ADCs 120 and 125 (output of ADCs) are processed in parallel (as shown in two parallel processing paths) for enabling real time decoding of the PAM-3 symbols. As
the master and slave data are processed in parallel, both are considered as input data to the FPGA module 130 and the manner in which they are processed is described
in further detail below.
Initially, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, ADC interface modules 205A and 205B sample the input LVDS ADC data. The sampled data is further de-serialized
using ISERDES modules inside the FPGA module 130 and stored in an internal buffer for further processing. FIG. 3 illustrates an exemplary ADC interface timing diagram
in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.
As the output of the directional coupler 105 is noisy, the ADCs 120 and 125 output are also noisy, and direct decoding of the outputs of the ADCs may lead to erroneous
outputs. Hence, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, DC correction is employed, through DC correction module 210A and 210B, on the ADCs output data to
compensate for the variations in the signal level. In one implementation, a time domain averaging based approach is used, as the noise is random, and any filtering of the
PAM-3 signal may make it further difficult to decode PAM-3 symbols. The block length used for DC Correction is 128, which means that present ADC sample and previous
127 ADC samples are considered for deciding the present DC corrected ADC sample. The block length can be varied based on the nature of ADC samples. FIG. 4A
illustrates ADC samples before DC correction. FIG. 4B illustrates DC corrected ADC samples in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure. In a preferred
embodiment, the upper and lower thresholds for DC correction are made programmable for enabling fine tuning during testing with different ECUs and test environments.
Option to disable DC Correction is also provided to use when the directional coupler 105 output is not very noisy (DC level does not vary much).
The formula for DC correction is as given below:
If (MAX>Plus_Threshold && MIN<Minus_Maximum_Threshold && (Actual_ADC_data−MIN+Minus_Threshold<255))
DC corrected value=Actual_ADC_data ̃MIN+Minus_Threshold
Else
DC corrected value=Actual_ADC_data
Where MAX and MIN are maximum and minimum values of ADC samples in one block of ADC samples
MAX>Plus_Threshold is used because DC Correction should not be done if data is continuously −1 and 0. MAX value will be low in this case and hence correction is not
done. FIG. 4C illustrates this scenario (continuous −1 and 0 without +1). MIN<Minus_Maximum_Threshold is used because DC Correction should not be done if data is
continuously +1 and 0. MIN value will be high in this case and hence correction is not done. FIG. 4D illustrates this scenario (continuous +1 and 0 without −1).
(Actual_ADC_data—MIN+Minus_Threshold<255) is used to take care of the condition where DC Corrected data is going above 255.
The DC corrected data is fed to Slope Detection and Level Decode modules 215A and 215B. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the slope detection and level
decode modules 215A and 215B are configured for decoding the PAM-3 levels based on four thresholds. That is, from the DC corrected data, the slope detection and
level decode modules 215A and 215B decodes the PAM-3 levels based on four thresholds, wherein the first threshold is for 0 to +1 or −1 to +1, the second threshold is
for 0 to −1 or +1 to  ̃1, the third threshold is for +1 to 0 and the fourth threshold is for −1 to 0. The threshold values can be predetermined and programmed.
Exemplary default values of the thresholds are as follows.
Plus Threshold=140
Minus Threshold=95
Zero Plus Threshold=160
Zero Minus Threshold=80
FIG. 4E illustrates the thresholds used. If present ADC sample is greater than previous ADC sample, it means the present sample may be going towards+1 or 0. To
decode this, two thresholds are used; Plus threshold and Zero Minus threshold. If present ADC sample is greater than Plus threshold, then the sample is +1. If present
ADC sample is lesser than Plus threshold but greater than Zero Minus threshold, then the sample is 0. If not, the sample value is same as the previous PAM3 level value.
If present and previous ADC samples are equal, then also the sample value is same as the previous PAM3 level value. If present ADC sample is smaller than previous
ADC sample, it means the present sample may be going towards −1 or 0. To decode this, remaining 2 thresholds are used; Minus Threshold and Zero Plus threshold and
the decoding logic is similar to that of positive slope.
Optional Dynamic Threshold feature is also supported if the directional coupler 105 output is too noisy and Fixed Threshold is resulting in erroneous decoding of PAM-3
levels. When Dynamic Threshold feature is enabled, all 4 thresholds are updated dynamically based on the difference in values of ADC samples corresponding to +1/0/−1

levels between each block. Block length is programmable, and the default block length is 12 samples corresponding to one PAM-3 symbol interval.
As the directional coupler 105 output is noisy, the decoded levels may have wrong transitions, and hence, the decoded signals are fed to the Spike Filter modules 220A
and 220B for filtering out spikes in the decoded signals. FIG. 4F illustrates spike filter logic. The outputs of the spike filter modules 220A and 220B, that is, the filtered
decoded signals, are the initial PAM-3 levels from where the PAM-3 symbol needs to be decoded by making sure that the sampling point is as per 100BASE-T1 data rate.
The method for deriving correct sampling point of PAM-3 levels is described in further detail below.
Initially, in one embodiment of the present disclosure, edge information of the filtered PAM-3 levels is registered using edge detection modules 225A and 225B. In one
implementation, if there exists positive to negative (+ve to −ve) or negative to positive (−ve to +ve) transition within twelve samples (corresponding to one PAM-3
symbol), those are considered as transitions that should not be missed, and this information is registered. For ease of understanding, such transitions are referred to as
“must transitions” in the present disclosure.
Upon identifying and registering the “must transitions”, midpoints of the “must transitions” are calculated, using midpoint detection modules 230A and 230B, which are
“must sampling points” that should not be missed. “must sampling points” are used to resynchronize the sampling points to PAM-3 symbol timing on 100BASE-T1 bus as
ADC sampling of PAM-3 signal is asynchronous sampling procedure (since ADC uses separate reference clock). It is to be noted that a zero value for a midpoint indicates
an invalid midpoint (corresponding to no valid ‘must transitions’).
Upon identifying the “must transitions”, first level edge filters 235A and 235B retain all the edges corresponding to the “must transitions”. Further, edges where distance
from previous edge is greater than or equal to nine samples are also retained. All other edges, which corresponds to erroneous transitions in levels due to non-ideal PAM-
3 signals, are filtered out. The output of the first level edge filters 235A and 235B are fed to a second level edge filters 240A and 240B for further filtering.
In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the second level edge filters 240A and 240B are configured for discarding an edge from the corresponding first level edge
filters 235A and 235B, if there is an edge corresponding to a “must transition” (as explained above) within the next four samples. For example, two such consecutive
edges may appear at the first level edge filters 235A and 235B output if the first edge meets the minimum distance requirement of nine samples and second edge meets
“must transition” requirement. In such a case, the second level edge filters 240A and 240B discard the first edge.
Upon identifying the “must transitions” by discarding the edges corresponding to the erroneous transitions in the levels due to non-ideal PAM-3 signals, sampling points
are calculated using sampling point calculation modules 245A and 245B, as shown in FIG. 2. In one embodiment of the present disclosure, the sampling point calculation
modules 245A and 245B calculates the sampling point based on the following scenarios.
For any Second Level Filtered edge, if there is a non-zero midpoint value corresponding to a “must transition”, the midpoint value is taken as the valid
sampling point. This ensure that the PAM-3 Level signals are sampled at the centre in such cases and does not miss even narrow edges. This is
illustrated in FIG. 4G.
For any second level filtered edge, if there is no non-zero midpoint value corresponding to a “must transition”, sampling point is taken as 12th sample
from previous sampling point. This covers the scenario where three are +1/0/−1 levels which are wider than the width of one PAM-3 symbol.
If there is no second level filtered edge, sampling point is taken every 12th sample; this covers the scenario where there are consecutive same data
(+1/0/−1). This is illustrated in FIG. 4H.
It is to be noted that erroneous sampling point may occur if there are same symbols consecutively for a long time. Hence, in one embodiment of the present disclosure,
upon calculating the sampling point, sampling point filters 250A and 250B are used for eliminating erroneous sampling points, if any. One or more filtering methods
implemented by the sampling point filters 250A and 250B are as follows:
For any Sampling Point, if it corresponds to a “must transition”, that is considered a valid sampling point and retained.
For any Sampling Point, if it does not correspond to a “must transition” and if there is a sampling point within next four samples, that sampling point is
discarded. Second sampling point will be a valid sampling point in this case. This is illustrated in FIG. 4I.
All other Sampling Points are retained.
Upon deriving the sampling point, PAM-3 symbol generation module (255A and 255B) generates PAM-3 symbols from the initial PAM-3 levels using the sampling point.
The generated PAM-3 symbols are fed to the computer having the appropriate software, using USB interfaces, for higher layer protocol decoding, and further analysis.
FIG. 5 illustrates a portion of an exemplary 100BASE-T1 signal captured using FPGA based system 100 in accordance with an embodiment of the present disclosure.
Referring to FIG. 5, 505 represents ADC Samples, 510 represents PAM-3 Level Signals, and 515 represents filtered sampling points.
The system disclosed in the present disclosure, employs a real time hardware based (FPGA based system) decoding of PAM-3 signals and uses fully pipelined Register
Transfer Level (RTL) architecture to implement the decoding logic. This enables real-time or near-real-time streaming of the decoded PAM-3 symbols to the computer
having the appropriate software for further higher level automotive Ethernet protocol decoding and analysis.
Even though the functions of the system are disclosed considering the example of 100BASTE-T1, 100 Mbps variant of automotive Ethernet standard, a person skilled in
the art will realise that the system may be implemented for decoding 1000BASE-T1 PAM-3 signals by increasing the ADC sampling rate and making corresponding
modifications in the FPGA module logic.
The figures and the foregoing description give examples of embodiments. Those skilled in the art will appreciate that one or more of the described elements may well be
combined into a single functional element. Alternatively, certain elements may be split into multiple functional elements. Elements from one embodiment may be added
to another embodiment. For example, orders of processes described herein may be changed and are not limited to the method described herein. Moreover, the actions of
any flow diagram need not be implemented in the order shown; nor do all the acts necessarily need to be performed. Also, those acts that are not dependent on other
acts may be performed in parallel with the other acts. The scope of embodiments is by no means limited by these specific examples. Numerous variations, whether
explicitly given in the specification or not, such as differences in structure, dimension, and use of material, are possible.

known structures and devices are schematically shown in order to simplify the drawing.
DETAILED DESCRIPTION
[0024] In the present embodiment, a Ternary Content Addressable Memory (TCAM)-based training method for Graph Neural Network is provided. Please refer to FIG. 1 ,
which shows an example of a graph GP applied the Graph Neural Network. The graph GP may include several vertexes VTi and several nodes Nj. The vertexes
VTi and the nodes Nj may be any person, any organization, or any department. The edges among the vertexes VTi and the nodes Nj store the features thereof.
The Graph Neural Network may be used to make the inference of the relationship between two of the vertexes VTi.
[0025] The TCAM-based training method can improve the training efficiency of the in-memory computing. Please refer to FIG. 2 , which shows a flowchart of the TCAM-
based training method for Graph Neural Network according to one embodiment. In step S110, sampling data from a dataset 900 is executed. Please refer FIG. 3
, which shows an example for executing the step S110. In FIG. 3 , several batches BCq will be performed the training step (the step S110) in several iterations.
[0026] In step S120, training the Graph Neural Network according to the data from the dataset 900 is executed. The step S120 includes a feature extraction phase P1,
an aggregation phase P2 and an update phase P3. Please refer FIG. 4 , which illustrates the feature extraction phase P1, the aggregation phase P2 and the
update phase P3. In the feature extraction phase P1, features on the edges and the nodes, are extracted. In the aggregation phase P2, several computing, such
as Multiply Accumulate is executed. In the update phase P3, weightings are updated. The aggregation phase P2 is an input/output-intensive task, and may incur
huge data movement. The training performance bottleneck is occurred at the aggregation phase P2.
[0027] To improve the training efficiency, an adaptive data reusing policy is applied in the step S110 of sampling data from the dataset 900, and a TCAM-based data
processing strategy and a dynamic fixed-point formatting approach are applied in the aggregation phase P2. The following illustrates the TCAM-based data
processing strategy and the dynamic fixed-point formatting approach first, then illustrates the adaptive data reusing policy.
[0028] The TCAM-based data processing strategy applied in the aggregation phase P2 includes an intra-vertex parallelism architecture and an inter-vertex parallelism
architecture. Please refer to FIG. 5 , which shows a crossbar matrix MX. In the present embodiment, a plurality of features x11, x12, x13, x21, x22, x23, x31, x32,
x33 can be stored in the crossbar matrix MX. The crossbar matrix MX is, for example, a Resistive random-access memory (ReRAM). The crossbar matrix MX
includes a plurality of word lines WL1, WL2, WL3, a plurality of bit lines BT1, BT2, BT3 and a plurality of cells. The cells store the features x11, x12, x13, x21, x22,
x23, x31, x32, x33, instead of weightings. In the aggregation phase P2, a plurality of coefficients a1, a2, a3 are inputted to the word lines WL1, WL2, WL3 and a
plurality of multiply accumulate results v1, v2, v3 are obtained from the bit lines BL1, BT2, BT3. 0 or 1 can be used to select any of the nodes X1, X2, X3. As
shown in FIG. 4 , [1, 0, 1] is a hit vector HV used to select the nodes X1, X3.
[0029] Please refer to FIG. 6 , which shows a TCAM crossbar matrix MX1 and a Multiply Accumulate (MAC) crossbar matrix MX2. In the aggregation phase P2, the
TCAM crossbar matrix MX1 stores a plurality of edges eg111, eg121, eg212, eg222, . . . corresponding to one vertex VT1 and outputs the hit vector HV for
selecting some of the edges eg111, eg121, eg212, eg222, . . . . The edge eg111 includes the source node u11 and the destination node u1. The edge eg121
includes the source node u12 and the destination node u1. The edge eg212 includes the source node u21 and the destination node u2. The edge eg222 includes
the source node u22 and the destination node u2.
[0030] The MAC crossbar matrix MX2 stores a plurality of features U11, U12, U21, U22, . . . in the edges eg111, eg121, eg212, eg222, . . . , for performing a multiply
accumulate operation according to the hit vector HV under the intra-vertex parallelism architecture. Some examples are provided here via the following
drawings.
[0031] Please refer to FIGS. 7 to 10 , which illustrate the operation of the TCAM crossbar matrix MX1 and the MAC crossbar matrix MX2. As shown in FIG. 7 , a search
vector SV1 is inputted to the TCAM crossbar matrix MX1. The content of the search vector SV1 is the destination node u1. The destination node u1 of the edge
eg111 matches the search vector SV1, so 1 is outputted. The destination node u1 of the edge eg121 matches the search vector SV1, so 1 is outputted. The
destination node u2 of the edge eg212 does not match the search vector SV1, so 0 is outputted. The destination node u2 of the edge eg222 does not match the
search vector SV1, so 0 is outputted. Therefore, the hit vector HV1, which is “[1, 1, 0, 0]”, is outputted to the MAC crossbar matrix MX2.
[0032] The hit vector HV1 is inputted to the MAC crossbar matrix MX2 for selecting the features U11, U12. As shown in FIG. 7 , a multiply accumulate result U1(1) is
obtained (the multiply accumulate result U1(1)=the feature U11+the feature U12).
[0033] As shown in FIG. 8 , a search vector SV2 is inputted to the TCAM crossbar matrix MX1. The content of the search vector SV2 is the destination node u2. The
destination node u1 of the edge eg111 does not match the search vector SV2, so 0 is outputted. The destination node u1 of the edge eg121 does not match the
search vector SV2, so 0 is outputted. The destination node u2 of the edge eg212 matches the search vector SV2, so 1 is outputted. The destination node u2 of

the edge eg222 matches the search vector SV2, so 1 is outputted. Therefore, the hit vector HV2, which is “[0, 0, 1, 1]”, is outputted to the MAC crossbar matrix
MX2.
[0034] The hit vector HV2 is inputted to the MAC crossbar matrix MX22 for selecting the features U21, U22. As shown in FIG. 8 , a multiply accumulate result U2(1) is
obtained (the multiply accumulate result U2(1)=the feature U21+the feature U22).
[0035] As shown in FIG. 9 , a TCAM crossbar matrix MX21 may further store the vertex VT1, . . . , the layer L0, L1, . . . and the edges eg11, eg21. The edges eg111,
eg121, eg212, eg222 are stored corresponding the vertex VT1 and the layer L0. The edges eg11, eg21 are stored corresponding to the vertex VT1 and the layer
L1. The edges eg11, eg21 are stored corresponding to the vertex VT1 and the layer L1. A search vector SV3 is inputted to the TCAM crossbar matrix MX21. The
content of the search vector SV3 is the vertex VT1 and the layer L0. The vertex VT1, the layer L0 and the edges eg111, eg212 corresponding thereto match the
search vector SV3, so 1 is outputted. The vertex VT1, the layer L0, and the edges eg121, eg222 corresponding thereto match the search vector SV3, so 1 is
outputted. The vertex VT1, the layer L1, and the edges eg11 corresponding thereto do not match the search vector SV3, so 0 is outputted. The vertex VT1, the
layer 1, and the edges eg21 corresponding thereto do not match the search vector SV3, so 0 is outputted. Therefore, the hit vector HV3, which is “[1, 1, 0, 0]”, is
outputted to the MAC crossbar matrix MX22.
[0036] The hit vector HV3 is inputted to the MAC crossbar matrix MX22 for selecting the features U11, U21 and selecting the features U12, U22. As shown in FIG. 9 , the
multiply accumulate results U1(1), U2(1) are obtained.
[0037] As shown in FIG. 10 , the MAC crossbar matrix MX22 further stores the multiply accumulate results U1(1), U2(1) respectively corresponding to the edges eg11,
eg21. A search vector SV4 is inputted to the TCAM crossbar matrix MX21. The content of the search vector SV4 is the vertex VT1 and the layer L1. The vertex
VT1, the layer L0 and the edges eg111, eg212 corresponding thereto do not match the search vector SV4, so 0 is outputted. The vertex VT1, the layer L0, the
edges eg121, eg222 corresponding thereto do not match the search vector SV4, so 0 is outputted. The vertex VT1, the layer L1 and the edges eg11
corresponding thereto match the search vector SV4, so 1 is outputted. The vertex VT1, the layer L1 and the edges eg21 corresponding thereto match the search
vector SV4, so 1 is outputted. Therefore, the hit vector HV4, which is “[0, 0, 1, 1]”, is outputted to the MAC crossbar matrix MX22.
[0038] The hit vector HV4 is inputted to the MAC crossbar matrix MX22 for selecting the multiply accumulate result U1(1), U2(1). As shown in FIG. 10 , a multiply
accumulate result is obtained.
[0039] In one embodiment, the TCAM crossbar matrix MX21 may further store a plurality of edges corresponding to another one vertex under the inter-vertex
parallelism architecture. The search vector can be used to select the particular vertex.
[0040] Base on above, in the inter-vertex parallelism architecture, the bank/matrix-level parallelism is utilized to aggregate different vertexes. And in the intra-vertex
parallelism architecture, the column bandwidth of a crossbar matrix is efficiently utilized to disperse the computation of the aggregation.
[0041] Please refer to FIGS. 11 to 13 , which illustrate the operation of the TCAM crossbar matrix MX311, MX312, . . . and the MAC crossbar matrix MX321, MX322, . . .
for several batches B1, B2, . . . , Bk. As shown in FIG. 11 , several TCAM crossbar matrixes MX311, MX312, . . . and several MAC crossbar matrixes MX321,
MX322, . . . are arranged in several memory banks. For the batch B1, the memory area A3111 is used to store the edge list of the vertex VT31, and the memory
area A3211 is used to store the features of the vertex VT31. The memory area A3121 is used to store the edge list of the vertex VT32, and the memory area
A3221 is used to store the features of the vertex VT32.
[0042] As shown in FIG. 12 , for the batch B2, the memory area A3112 is used to store the edge list of the vertex VT33, and the memory area A3212 is used to store the
features of the vertex VT33. The memory area A3122 is used to store the edge list of the vertex VT34, and the memory area A3222 is used to store the features
of the vertex VT34.
[0043] As shown in FIG. 13 , for the batch Bk, the memory area A3111 is used to store the edge list of the vertex VT35, and the memory area A3211 is used to store the
features of the vertex VT35. The memory area A3121 is used to store the edge list of the vertex VT36, and the memory area A3221 is used to store the features
of the vertex VT36. That is to say, the same memory area can be reused for different vertexes. The memory can be efficiently utilized.
[0044] In one case, the column bandwidth of the MAC crossbar matrix may not enough for store the feature of one node or one vertex. To avoid speed downgrade, a
pipeline operation can be applied here. Please refer to FIG. 14 , which illustrates the pipeline operation in the TCAM-based data processing strategy. As shown in
FIG. FIG. 14 , the feature U11 is divided into two parts pt21, pt22 and stored in two rows. The edge eg111 is stored in two rows of the TCAM crossbar matrix
MX41. The aggregations for the parts pt21, pt22 are independent. At the time T1, the aggregation phase P2 for the part pt21 is executed; at the time T2, the
update phase P3 for the part pt21 can be started to be executed. At the time T2, the aggregation phase P2 for the part pt22 is executed; at the time T3, the
update phase P3 for the part pt22 can be started to be executed.
[0045] The dynamic fixed-point formatting approach is also applied in the aggregation phase P2. The weightings or the features stored in the crossbar matrix may have
floating-point format. In the present technology, the weightings or the features can be stored in the crossbar matrix via a dynamic fixed-point format. Please refer
to FIG. 15 , which illustrates the dynamic fixed-point formatting approach. As shown in the following table I, the weightings can be represented as the floating-
point format.
[0046]

0.4721.11100011 × 2{circumflex over ( )}-2111000112{circumflex over ( )}-2
The exponent range is from 2{circumflex over (
G1. The group G0 is from 2{circumflex over (
)}-0 to 2{circumflex over (
)}-0 to 2{circumflex over (
)}-7. In this embodiment, the exponent range can be classified into two groups G0,
)}-3, and the group G1 is from 2{circumflex over (
)}-4 to 2{circumflex over (
)}-7. As
shown in FIG. 15 , if the exponent of the data is within the group G0, “0” is stored; if the exponent of the data is within the group G1, “1” is stored. For precisely
representing “2-0”, the mantissa is shifted by 0 bit. For precisely representing “2{circumflex over (
representing “2{circumflex over (

)}-6”, the mantissa is shifted by 2 bits. For precisely representing “2{circumflex over (
)}-7”, the
mantissa is shifted by 3 bits. For example, the weighting wt1 is “0.2165”, the mantissa “0.2165” is “10111011”, the last bit is “0” to represent the group G0, and
the mantissa “10111011” is shifted by 3 bits to precisely representing “2{circumflex over (
)}-3.” The weighting wt2 is “0.472”, the mantissa “0.472” is
“11100011”, the last bit is “0” to represent the group G0, and the mantissa “11100011” is shifted by 2 bits to precisely representing “2{circumflex over (
)}-2.”
[0047] According to the dynamic fixed-point formatting approach, the 7 exponents are classified into only two groups G0 and G1, so the computing cycle can be
reduced from 7 to 2, the computing speed can be greatly increased.
[0048] Furthermore, the adaptive data reusing policy applied for the step S110 of sampling data from the dataset 900 is illustrated as below. The adaptive data reusing
policy includes a bootstrapping approach, a graph partitioning approach and a non-uniform bootstrapping approach.
[0049] Please refer to FIG. 16 , which illustrates the bootstrapping approach. Each of batches BC1, BC2, BC3, BC4 is used to execute one iteration. The batch BC1
includes the data of the nodes N1, N2, N5; the batch BC2 includes the data of the nodes N1, N3, N6; the batch BC3 includes the data of the nodes N5, N3, N6; the
https://patents.google.com/patent/US20230162024A1/en

US20230162024A1 - Ternary content addressable memory (tcam)-based training method for graph neural network and me...
batch BC4 includes the data of the nodes N4, N3, N2. The data of the node N1 is repeated within the batches BC1 and the batch BC2. The data of the node N3 is
repeated within the batches BC3 and the batch BC4.
[0050] According to the bootstrapping approach, some data is repeated within two batches, so the data movement can be greatly reduced. The training performance
can be improved.
[0051] Please refer to FIG. 17 , which illustrates the graph partitioning approach. In a graph, the graph size (number of all of the nodes) is n and the batch size (number
of the nodes in one batch) is b. The reusing rate is b/n. If the reusing rate is too low, the bootstrapping approach may not cause a great improvement, the graph
is needed to be partitioned for increasing the reusing rate. As shown in FIG. 17 , the nodes in the graph are randomly segmented into 3 partitions. The reusing
rate will be increased 3 times. The data of the nodes N11 to N14 are arranged in the batches BC11 to BC13. The data of the nodes N12, N14 are repeated within
the batches BC11 and the batch BC12. The data of the nodes N13, N14 are repeated within the batches BC12 and the batch BC13.
[0052] The data of the nodes N21 to N25 are arranged in the batches BC21 to BC23. The data of the nodes N23, N25 are repeated within the batches BC21 and the
batch BC22. The data of the node N21 is repeated within the batches BC22 and the batch BC23.
[0053] According to the graph partitioning approach, the reusing rate is increased and the bootstrapping approach still has a great improvement even if the graph is
large.
[0054] Please refer to FIG. 18 , which illustrates the non-uniform bootstrapping approach. In the bootstrapping approach, data of some of the nodes are repeatedly
sampled, so some of the nodes may be sampled too much times and the accuracy may be affected. As shown in FIG. 18 , sampling probabilities of the nodes
are non-uniform. After some times of iteration, the sampling times of the node N8 is above out of a boundary, so the sampling probability of the node N8 is
reduced to be 0.826% which is lower than the sampling probability of the other nodes.
[0055] According to the non-uniform bootstrapping approach, any node may not be sampled too much times and the accuracy can be kept.
[0056] The adaptive data reusing policy including the bootstrapping approach, the graph partitioning approach and the non-uniform bootstrapping approach can be
executed via the following flowchart. Please refer to FIG. 19 , which shows a flowchart of the adaptive data reusing policy according to one embodiment. In step
S111, whether the reusing rate is lower than a predetermined value is determined. If the reusing rate is lower than the predetermined value, then the process
proceeds to step S112; if the reusing rate is not lower than the predetermined value, then the process proceeds to step S113.
[0057] In the step S112, the graph partitioning approach is executed.
[0058] In the step S113, whether the sampling time of any node is out of the boundary is determined. If the sampling time of any node is out of the boundary, the
process proceeds to step S114; if the sampling times of all of the nodes are not out of the boundary, the process proceeds to step S115.
[0059] In the step S114, the non-uniform bootstrapping approach is executed.
[0060] In the step S115, the (uniform) bootstrapping approach executed.
[0061] Moreover, please refer to FIG. 20 , which shows a memory device 1000 adopted the training method described above. The memory device 1000 includes a
controller 100 and a memory array 200. The memory array 200 is connected to the controller 100. The memory array 200 includes at least one TCAM crossbar
matrix MXm1 and at least one MAC crossbar matrix MXm2. The TCAM crossbar matrix MXm1 stores the edges egij corresponding to one vertex. The TCAM
crossbar matrix MXm1 receives a search vector SVt, and then outputs a hit vector HVt for selecting some of the edges egij. The MAC crossbar matrix MXm2
stores a plurality of features in the edges egij for performing the multiply accumulate operation according to the hit vector HVt.
[0062] According to the embodiments described above, in the TCAM-based training method for Graph Neural Network, the adaptive data reusing policy is applied in the
sampling step (step S110), and the TCAM-based data processing strategy and the dynamic fixed-point formatting approach are applied in the aggregation phase
P2. The data movement can be greatly reduced and accuracy can be kept. The training efficiency of the in-memory computing, especially for the Graph Neural
Network, is greatly improved.
[0063] It will be apparent to those skilled in the art that various modifications and variations can be made to the disclosed embodiments. It is intended that the
specification and examples be considered as exemplary only, with a true scope of the disclosure being indicated by the following claims and their equivalents.
