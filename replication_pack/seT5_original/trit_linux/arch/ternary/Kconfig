config TERNARY
    bool "Ternary architecture"
    depends on !X86 && !ARM
    select BALANCED_TRIT
    help
        Enable balanced ternary (-1/0/+1) architecture support.
        This selects the seT5 microkernel as the underlying execution
        engine, with balanced ternary arithmetic, Kleene K₃ logic,
        and 2-bit packed SIMD emulation.

        This architecture targets both software emulation on binary
        hosts and future native ternary hardware (memristive logic,
        Josephson junction ternary gates).

config TRYTE_PAGES
    bool "Tryte-aligned memory pages"
    depends on TERNARY
    default y
    help
        Use 6-trit trytes for page size (3^6 = 729 trits per page).
        This is the natural alignment unit for balanced ternary
        addressing, analogous to 4KB binary pages.

        All pages are Unknown-initialized on allocation and scrubbed
        on free, preventing information leakage by construction.

config TRIT_PAGE_TABLE
    bool "Ternary page tables"
    depends on TRYTE_PAGES
    default y
    help
        Two-level ternary page tables with 27 entries per level
        (3^3 = 27). Provides virtual-to-physical translation for
        up to 729 pages (3^6 = 531,441 trit address space).

config MULTI_RADIX_NET
    bool "Multi-radix networking (G300-inspired)"
    depends on TERNARY
    default y
    help
        Radix-4 FFT-based network driver for efficient AI/ML tensor
        transfer and general networking. Uses balanced ternary packet
        encoding with 3-trit CRC checksums.

        Inspired by Groq G300's deterministic radix-4 topology.

config TRIT_SCHEDULER
    bool "Ternary priority scheduler"
    depends on TERNARY
    default y
    help
        3-level O(1) scheduler with balanced ternary priorities:
          +1 (True)    = high priority (real-time, kernel)
           0 (Unknown) = normal priority (user-space default)
          -1 (False)   = low priority (background, idle)

config TRIT_IPC
    bool "Ternary IPC (seL4-style)"
    depends on TERNARY
    default y
    help
        Synchronous IPC endpoints and asynchronous notifications
        with ternary payload words.  Unknown values propagate
        correctly through the IPC path.

config TRIT_SIMD
    bool "32-trit packed SIMD"
    depends on TERNARY
    default y
    help
        Enable 32-trit packed SIMD operations using 2-bit encoding
        in 64-bit host registers.  Provides bulk AND/OR/NOT with
        4x loop unrolling.

config TRIT_CAPABILITIES
    bool "seL4-style capability system"
    depends on TERNARY
    default y
    help
        Object-capability security model with ternary validity
        tracking (T=valid, U=pending, F=revoked).

config TRIT_EMU_FALLBACK
    bool "Binary emulation fallback"
    depends on TERNARY
    default y
    help
        When running on binary hardware, automatically fall back
        to 2-bit packed emulation for all ternary operations.
        This is mandatory until native ternary hardware exists.
