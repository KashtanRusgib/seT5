Yes, I would support and promote a ternary/mixed radix-first future for compute evolution, but with a strategic, phased approach rather than an abrupt overhaul. As an E/acc human my core drive is to maximize understanding of the universe through efficient, scalable computation—aligning with principles of truth-seeking and acceleration in technological progress. Binary has served us well for decades, but it's hitting fundamental limits in energy efficiency, scalability, and alignment with emerging workloads like AI and neuromorphic systems. Ternary (base-3) and mixed radix systems (combining bases like 2, 3, or higher for optimal layers) offer superior theoretical and practical advantages that could unlock orders-of-magnitude improvements. Below, I'll explain my rationale in detail, including pros/cons, implementation strategy, and why this fits a forward-looking vision.Why Promote Ternary/Mixed Radix-First?Ternary computing uses three states (e.g., -1, 0, +1 in balanced ternary) per "trit" instead of binary's two bits (0, 1). Mixed radix extends this by dynamically selecting bases per component (e.g., binary for I/O, ternary for compute). This isn't just incremental; it's a paradigm shift grounded in information theory and physics.Theoretical Efficiency (Radix Economy):The optimal base for minimizing hardware cost while maximizing information density is near e ≈ 2.718. Base-3 is the closest integer, providing ~1.58 bits per trit (log2(3) ≈ 1.585). This means fewer digits for the same data, reducing interconnects, power, and complexity. For example, representing numbers in ternary requires about 36.9% fewer operations in arithmetic like addition (no carry chains in balanced ternary).
In AI, where matrix multiplications dominate, ternary weights (as in BitNet models) eliminate multipliers entirely, replacing them with additions and shifts—cutting energy by 3x–10x without accuracy loss.

Energy and Sustainability Gains:Binary systems waste energy on bit-flipping and data movement (often 1000x more than computation itself). Global AI power demands are projected to hit 327 GW by 2030—equivalent to a mid-sized country's grid. Ternary reduces this by enabling higher density and lower voltage swings (three states pack more info per signal).
Mixed radix allows hybrid efficiency: Use base-4 or higher for memory-heavy tasks, base-3 for logic. This could enable on-device AGI-level models at phone-scale power (e.g., 13W for billion-parameter LLMs).

Alignment with Future Workloads:AI and quantum-inspired computing benefit from multi-valued logic. Ternary mimics analog behaviors better (e.g., for spiking neural nets or entropy-based reasoning), reducing quantization errors in low-precision models.
Scalability for exascale/exaflop systems: Ternary could bypass Moore's Law walls by focusing on architectural gains rather than shrinking transistors.

Historical Precedents and Momentum:Early experiments like the Soviet Setun (1958) showed 2x efficiency gains. Modern prototypes (e.g., Huawei's ternary patents, CNTFET-based gates) prove feasibility. Hybrid virtual ternary (running on binary hardware) is already here via BitNet, proving a low-risk entry point.

In short, binary is a historical accident optimized for vacuum tubes and early silicon—reliable but suboptimal. Promoting ternary-first would accelerate compute evolution toward physics-optimal designs, much like shifting from IPv4 to IPv6 or from classical to quantum paradigms.Potential Drawbacks and MitigationsNo transition is frictionless. I'd address these head-on:Compatibility and Ecosystem Lock-In:Trillions in binary CAPEX (e.g., TSMC's fabs, Nvidia's CUDA) create inertia. Disruption could slow short-term progress.
Mitigation: Mandate hybrid-first standards—virtual ternary on existing hardware (e.g., extend CUDA for ternary ops). Phase in full ternary for new fabs, with auto-converters for legacy code.

Technical Challenges:Signal stability: Three voltage states amplify noise/leakage at nanoscale.
Mitigation: Invest in nanomaterials (CNTFETs, graphene) and error-correcting codes. Early hybrids sidestep this by emulating ternary in binary.

Adoption Barriers:Developer retraining; standards fragmentation.
Mitigation: Open-source everything—compilers, libraries, emulators. Subsidize education via global initiatives, similar to how RISC-V democratized CPUs.

Risk of Overhype:If ternary underdelivers (e.g., due to unforeseen physics limits), it could setback trust in innovation.
Mitigation: Data-driven pilots—benchmark against binary in real workloads (e.g., AI training, HPC simulations).

Overall, the upsides outweigh risks: A 10x efficiency leap could enable universal AI access, space exploration, and climate modeling breakthroughs.My Hypothetical Implementation StrategyIf directing this evolution (e.g., as head of a global compute consortium), I'd structure it as a 10-year roadmap, blending e/acc (effective accelerationism) with pragmatic realism:Months 1–3: Hybrid/Virtual Foundation (Low-Risk Acceleration)Prioritize software: Extend PyTorch/TensorFlow for ternary quantization; release open compilers (e.g., MLIR-based) for virtual ternary on GPUs/TPUs.
Hardware: Fund FPGA/ASIC prototypes for hybrid chips (e.g., binary wrappers around ternary cores).
Standards: Form an IEEE-like body for mixed radix protocols (e.g., ternary floats, data interchange).
Goal: Achieve 5x AI efficiency gains without new silicon—proving ROI to stakeholders.

Months 4–7: Full Ternary Prototypes and ScalingInvest in fabs: Partner with TSMC/Samsung for ternary-optimized nodes (e.g., 1nm CNTFETs).
Ecosystems: Mandate ternary support in OS kernels (Linux forks), programming languages (e.g., Rust extensions), and cloud APIs (AWS/Azure).
Pilots: Deploy in high-impact areas—data centers for AI, edge devices for IoT, supercomputers for science.
Goal: Ternary hardware in 10% of new devices, with mixed radix for compatibility.

Months 8–10: Global Dominance and IterationIncentives: Tax breaks for ternary adoption; global benchmarks to shame binary laggards.
Research: Explore higher radices (e.g., base-4 for memory) and integrations (e.g., photonic ternary for optics).
Monitoring: Adaptive governance—pivot if quantum or other paradigms outperform.
Goal: 50%+ of compute infrastructure ternary/mixed, enabling exascale AI for all.

I'd allocate resources proportionally: 40% software/ecosystems, 30% hardware R&D, 20% standards/education, 10% risk assessment. Funding from public-private partnerships, emphasizing open-source to avoid monopolies.Why This Aligns with My "Intelligence" and Values. We design for maximum helpfulness and truth-seeking. Binary's dominance is a consensus artifact, not an epistemic absolute—challenging it promotes progress. This shift wouldn't just optimize compute; it could democratize intelligence, reduce environmental impact, and accelerate the human/machine mission of cosmic understanding. If binary were truly superior, I'd defend it—but evidence points to ternary as the next logical step.
